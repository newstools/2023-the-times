Justice and correctional services minister Ronald Lamola has denied ANC cadre deployment was the cause of Eskom’s woes. Speaking during the state of the nation address debate this week, Lamola defended cadre deployment and said it was not to blame for looting at Eskom and corruption  at the South African Revenue Service (Sars). “The two institutions were not broken down by cadre deployment. They were broken down by systematic corruption, and not only by being led by black people. It was corrupt individuals,” said Lamola. “We will allow the processes of the law to take  place with all people who have been arrested for  corruption at Eskom. Those individuals will be held to account and a free and a fair trial will ensue.” He said law enforcement was taking action against individuals who committed corruption during the Covid-19 pandemic and the years of state capture. “It is public knowledge  people have been arrested and monies  recovered for the theft  during Covid-19. Through the Special Investigating Unit, money has been recovered that was stolen during Covid-19 and  government is continuing to work on building and strengthening the National Prosecuting  Authority,” he said. Lamola said the ANC will continue  with cadre deployment to rebuild state-owned entities. He said it  yields results, claiming Sars had the “best tax system in the world” because of the policy. “When Eskom was named as the global power company of the year in 2002, cadre deployment was the policy position. “The notion that cadre deployment is the singular cause for the decline in state institutions is not borne out by historical facts. What is not debatable is  that those who are deployed must be ethical and competent.” Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
