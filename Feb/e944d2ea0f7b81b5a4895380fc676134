I absolutely love the work they do. I am inspired by their commitment to action, changing our world for the better through concrete steps. I look forward to learning more, and even becoming a small part of the exciting projects they have coming up,” she captioned her post Her mentions were flooded with congratulatory comments. “One for the books buddy. Super well done. Proverbs 22:29: Have you seen a man who is expert in his business? He will take his place before kings; his place will not be among low persons,” wrote Ayanda Thabethe. “Lorna, you are always inspiring. I love your joy in teaching, mentoring and helping others. We should all strive to live life like yours. When I see your shows on YouTube.  I stop to watch and feel inspired. You are an awesome lady. From Alabama, yours truly. Have a great day,” commented one Insta user. Lorna has been making money moves and one of her latest gigs was hosting a BBC Lifestyle show Homegrown Tastes South Africa, which premiered  in March last year. Speaking to True Love she shared her excitement about hosting the show. “Getting an international-based show has always been one of my goals because it’s time to put South Africa on the culinary global stage. Another highlight for me is  how beautiful this country is. There are gems here and, I guess with Covid-19 restrictions being eased  people can travel and see that,” she said.
