AKA's mother, Lynn Forbes, has assured DJ Zinhle and Nadia Nakai of her continued love and support after the death of her son. Kiernan “AKA” Forbes was gunned down outside a popular restaurant in Durban on Friday evening. Also shot dead was his lifelong friend, celebrity chef  Tebello “Tibz” Motsoane. Taking the podium at the memorial service held at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg on Friday, Lynn addressed the Megacy (AKA's fans), thanking them for their contribution to her son's career. Lynn went on to celebrate AKA's girlfriend Nadia Nakai, and DJ Zinhle Jiyane, who is AKA's ex-girlfriend as well as his baby mama. In her speech, Lynn, responding to speculation  on social media that their situation was unconventional,  said they had a loving relationship. “I want to celebrate at this time Zinhle and Nadia. This is not a normal situation for most people,” she said. “Sometimes, I don't do Twitter but, when I go there sometimes and I find all these things I think, 'Come on people it's all love over here. I aimed to have two sons but what I've gained are three daughters. Britney, Nadia and Zinhle. And forever, both of you, though Kiernan is not around any more, you are always welcome and you will always be my daughters, and I don't care what anybody says on social media about you. They don't matter. You matter because I love you ... Don design I love you my son.” Watch the video below: Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
