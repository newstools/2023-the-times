Yanga Sobetwa has sympathised with DJ Zinhle and Kairo after the death of AKA. Kiernan “AKA” Forbes was assassinated  outside a popular Durban restaurant on Friday evening.  His lifelong friend, chef and author Tebello “Tibz” Motsoane, also lost his life in the shooting. The Idols SA season 14 winner penned a lengthy heartfelt prayer to AKA's daughter Kairo as his ex-girlfriend and baby mama DJ Zinhle Jiyane on her Instagram timeline on Monday. In the post, Yanga spoke of the pains of children being raised by single mothers due to their fathers being murdered. “I don’t even know what to say. My heart is heavy and disappointed in the happenings of this world. So many children grow up with no fathers due to teenage pregnancy but a huge amount of those who have responsible fathers have them take away (killed), what an evil world! “My prayer for Kairo and the Forbes family: Holy Spirit, our Advocate and our Comforter do a work only you can do. It won’t make sense and it may never but Jesus I pray for peace that surpasses all human understanding, Lord I believe you will guide Zinhle and be a father to Kairo, I pray that you cover her with your love, your truth. I pray for salvation over negative thoughts, salvation of her heart and her life in Jesus’ name. Amen. Shalom.”
