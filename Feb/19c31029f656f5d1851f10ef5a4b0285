A KwaZulu-Natal man who shot dead his wife’s  lover had a chance of “reflection to desist from his conduct” of plotting the November 2021 murder. This is according to Durban high court judge Kate Pillay, who sentenced 44-year-old Phumlani Sangweni to 20 years’ imprisonment for killing John Bhengu. Bhengu died from his  injuries in Stanger Hospital. “He had been purposeful and deliberate. Crimes of this nature are endemic in the country. This is despite there being avenues to resolve disputes,” said Pillay. Sangweni was linked by cellphone records and  conversations that placed him near the scene in Glendale Heights on the outskirts of KwaDukuza. Pillay found  there were exceptional circumstances that allowed her to deviate from the minimum prescribed sentence of life imprisonment. She said Sangweni had not shown remorse as he pleaded not guilty. He also did not testify during arguments in the mitigation of sentence. “The court could glean a glimpse of pain that the infidelity had brought to him. Common sense detects the pain of betrayal and frustration must have driven the accused on the course that he did,” said Pillay. She felt that this did not detract from the enormity of his actions. “The court cannot ignore the frailty of the emotions,” she added. Pillay said the court accepted that both families had endured suffering as a result. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
