The Stilfontein magistrate’s court on Thursday postponed the case against 21 suspected illegal miners to February 15 for bail applications and further investigations. Twenty of the  suspects were arrested by the Hawks at a mineshaft in Stilfontein, North West, in October last year  after weeks of surveillance  of alleged illegal mining activities. Fifteen AK-47 rifles, six hunting rifles, two shotguns,  one R5 rifle, boxes of ammunition, explosives and an undisclosed amount of money were seized. The  last accused, who was arrested at his home, is suspected of transporting food and goods to illegal miners  on site. His vehicle was seized. On Thursday the attorney representing six of the accused requested a postponement to prepare  a bail application. The state did not oppose it. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Henry Mamothame said two of the six applicants are from Lesotho, one from Swaziland and three are South Africans. One accused is  out on R5,000 bail while 14  have not  applied for bail. Mamothame said the state was studying the  preliminary charges of conspiracy to commit robbery, possession of  illegal firearms and  ammunition and contravention of the Immigration Act. The possibility of  additional charges was not ruled out. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
