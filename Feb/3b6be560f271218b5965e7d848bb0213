Police are looking for two women who allegedly held students at gunpoint and robbed them at a mall in Mpumalanga. The women allegedly preyed on two female students at Riverside Mall in Mbombela on February 8. Armed with a firearm in a handbag,  the women pretended to ask the students for directions, police spokesperson Brig Selvy Mohlala said. As the students were showing the women the way, one of the suspects showed them a gun inside her handbag. She then held the victims hostage, threatening to kill them if they screamed,  said Mohlala. The two students were threatened and  robbed of their belongings, including two iPhones and a wristwatch. A case of robbery with a firearm was opened, said Mohlala. “The investigators are adamant that the woman in the attached picture may assist them in their investigation. The person being depicted on the picture is therefore urged to immediately go to the nearest police station,” Mohlala said. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police.
