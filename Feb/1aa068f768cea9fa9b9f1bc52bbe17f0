As some of the country's most  known political faces gear up to walk the state of the nation address red carpet, the ceremony has been thrown into debate. Every year the opening of parliament is marked with pomp, ceremony and fine fashion. This year's speech will be  delivered by President Cyril Ramaphosa at 7pm in the Cape Town City Hall as parliament is still being repaired after a fire last year. The red carpet and other festivities will precede the address. The  event will reportedly cost  about R8m. South Africa faces several crises, including load-shedding, fuel and food price hikes, crime, unemployment and service delivery failures, leading to some people suggesting the glitzy show of opulence may be in poor taste while so many citizens are struggling. Others said it was a necessary distraction from  politicking. A few said the  physical Sona should be scrapped and  be  a virtual address. MPs stepped out in  their glam last year after the red carpet was scrapped in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and  state of disaster regulations. That year's event also saw no procession  by the three arms of state, a praise  singer, military parade leading the presidential procession, guard of honour by the national ceremonial guard or 21-gun salute. It was a hybrid sitting with  only 50 people allowed in the  chamber. Most  MPs joined virtually. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
