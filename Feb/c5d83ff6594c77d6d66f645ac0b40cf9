A 38-year-old  suspect has been arrested after being caught at a  Barberton dumping site in Mpumalanga on Sunday allegedly pushing a trolley which had  a 19-year-old woman’s body  wrapped inside a bag. According to  police, the suspicious-looking man caught the attention of three  women when they  saw him pushing a trolley that seemed heavy for him. “The  women stopped a  taxi operator  at  traffic lights and requested him to assist in investigating.  When the suspect saw them, the bag fell from the  trolley. The bag was opened by one of the concerned citizens and  a woman’s body was allegedly found inside,” said Mpumalanga police spokesperson Brig Selvy Mohlala. He said police in Barberton were  called, and when they arrived they found  community members had  assaulted the suspect. “Officers managed to calm  the situation and the suspect was rescued from the angry mob. He was arrested and taken to hospital to receive treatment under police guard,” said Mohlala. He said the motive and cause of death are yet to be established and a post-mortem will be conducted.
