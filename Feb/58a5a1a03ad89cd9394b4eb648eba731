Mamelodi Sundowns are playing breathtaking attacking football this season as they swagger their way to an almost certain record-extending sixth successive Premier Soccer League (PSL) title. With 10 matches remaining in their season, the Brazilians are overwhelming favourites to defend their league championship title as they enjoy a 21-point advantage, albeit with second-placed Richards Bay having played two games less. TimesLIVE looks at their staggering numbers so far this season: 7 — Sundowns have won all  seven matches in all competitions in January 2023, the most wins by a team in a single month in PSL history. 50 — Sundowns became the fastest team to reach the 50-point mark in the PSL. They did so in 20 games to break the record  previously held by Kaizer Chiefs of 21. 10 — Downs have won 10 consecutive home league games to equal the PSL record  was set by themselves in 1999. 14 — With the win over Sekhukhune United last weekend, the Brazilians extended the PSL record for consecutive league wins to a staggering 14 matches. 10 — Rulani Mokwena is the first coach to win his first 10 league games in charge of a club in the history of the PSL. 15 — Sundowns have beaten all  opposing teams in the DStv Premiership at least once this season, and by so doing they have equalled a 100% PSL record  set by Kaizer Chiefs in 2013-14 and 2014-15. 17 — Sundowns have scored in 17 consecutive league games, their second-best run of scoring in the PSL after 20 in 1999. Orlando Pirates hold the PSL record for consecutive league games with a goal, netting in 29 straight matches in 2000-01. 6 — Sundowns have won six consecutive away league games to equal their joint-best run in the PSL (six away wins in a row in 2008). Only Manning Rangers (10 in 1996-97) and Kaizer Chiefs (seven in 2001) have had better away runs. 12 — Sundowns  opened the scoring in 12 consecutive DStv Premiership matches. Their best run in the club's PSL history was 11 in 2013/14. Statistics by OptaJabu
