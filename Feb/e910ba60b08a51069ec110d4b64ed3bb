Defence lawyers in the Nulane trial have continued to accuse the lead investigator in the case of failing to undertake  investigations because they were allegedly not aligned with an already set goal. During his third day on the stand, lead investigator Mandla Mtolo was also accused of not following processes  when he handled  exhibit documents seized from the Free State department of agriculture and rural development. The trial, set to run until next  Friday, is based on an alleged corrupt tender in which  money was paid to Nulane Investments to conduct a feasibility study for the Free State’s Mohoma Mobung project. The six accused are: Kenny Oldwage, representing Patel, told Mtolo the exhibits were handled by “every Tom, Dick and Harry”. He also asked Mtolo why he didn’t file exhibits presented in the case in the evidence room  available at all high courts in the country, including the Free State High Court where the trial is taking place. “Maybe you fiddled with them,” said Oldwage. Mtolo  admitted he was the one  who filed the exhibits  at Glen police station in Bloemfontein in March 2020, not his colleague Capt Isaac Bunu, who has since retired. Mtolo had, when his evidence was led by prosecutor Peter Serunye, told the court it was Bunu who had done  so. On Tuesday he told the court  he made an error. Mike Hellens, representing Gupta employee  Ragavan and Gupta company Islandsite, told Mtolo had he investigated the origins of letter from an Indian company that led to the R24.9m tender, the court would be in a better position knowing if the letter was legitimate. “You kept your eyes and the prosecution’s eyes shut to anything that didn’t speak to your goal,” claimed Hellens.
