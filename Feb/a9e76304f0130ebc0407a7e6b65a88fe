Mzansi is so used to media personality Lerato Kganyago winning Valentine’s Day Olympics that they are waiting with bated breath to see what 2023 brings. Despite “sitting this one out”, Lerato charted the Twitter trends on Tuesday as tweeps were curious if this year's gift would top last year’s. “Lerato Kganyago the face of SA’s Valentines day. The first woman to have a 94,000 seater stadium booked for her with Zonke to perform for her. Her husband also bought her a Boutique Hotel. This valentines day we wait for Thami to bring her Jesus straight from Heaven,” tweeted one. “Saw Lerato Kganyago post. The hun is in USA... they prolly buying her the whole of Disneyland and shares ko Walmart, New York . Happy Lerato Kganyago Day bafe,” tweeted another. Last month, Lerato on Twitter said she was giving V-Day a miss this year. She was replying to a follower who reminded her Valentine’s was around the corner. “It should remain in that corner. Re busy ra bereka,” she replied to the tweet. Last year she unveiled hubby Thami Ndlela's Valentine's gift on social media — an investment in a hotel and restaurant named after her. The media personality on Instagram revealed her husband helped her renovatea mansion she turned into a five-star boutique hotel called 12 on Hillel Villa and Spa. The hotel also has a restaurant called Amour (French for “love”, a direct translation of “Lerato”). “Some of you might have seen what it looked like before, a few months ago when I posted it on my Insta stories. I can’t wait for you to see the final product. He said: ‘Stop stressing Hold my Taelo umfazi wam [my wife], let me show you something,’” she wrote. On Valentine's Day in 2021, Lerato found her name at the top of Mzansi's trends list after her hubby booked out the entire FNB stadium and had songstress Zonke serenade her. The couple also enjoyed a candlelit dinner.
