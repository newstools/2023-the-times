The Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed the tourism minister’s application for leave to appeal  an order stating  she  could not use race-based criteria to grant relief to tourism businesses during the Covid-19 lockdown. The  court dismissed the matter with costs and said  it had become moot. During the lockdown,  the minister  awarded relief from the R200m Tourism Relief Fund  to tourism enterprises affected by the pandemic. Trade union Solidarity and civil rights group AfriForum went to court to review the decision of the department's use of race as a benchmark for  awarding  relief to tourism  businesses. The high court ruled  the  criteria used by the department did not perpetuate an unfair advantage for some candidates over others based on race, but  had the effect of providing those candidates with a head start. Solidarity and AfriForum appealed  the decision in the Supreme Court of Appeal. The court ruled in 2021 that the minister was not legally obliged by the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act to make eligibility for assistance from the Tourism Relief Fund subject to the Tourism BBBE Sector Code. The appeal court said the order it made did not authorise or oblige the minister to recover funds already disbursed from the relief fund. Despite this ruling, the minister appealed to the ConCourt. Reading a summary of the judgment, chief justice Raymond Zondo said  there were no sound reasons for the court to entertain  the matter as it was moot. He said apart from  this,  the court's  workload had increased after the introduction of the 17th Constitution Amendment Act. The  amendment  increased the scope of cases the court deals with. Before the amendment, the  court was the highest court in  constitutional matters, but now it is empowered to also decide  other matters.
