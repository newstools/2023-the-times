Former model turned author Sonia Booth  started a new business venture this Valentine's Day, taking the infamous cheesecake to the markets for all to indulge in. On Tuesday, Sonia announced the launch of her marula-flavoured frozen yoghurt and ice cream cheesecake for Valentine's Day on Instagram. “It was a no-brainer. Everybody that talks about me doesn't finish a sentence until they mention cheesecake. The name cheesecake was trending not just in South Africa, not just in Africa, but worldwide. People living in New York, people living in Massachusetts were sending me messages of support,” she told TshisaLIVE. She said she would be selling 50 homemade cheesecakes. Last year, Sonia  and former Bafana Bafana footballer Matthew Booth were the talk of town after she took to social media to detail an alleged affair  her husband had with a married woman. She said she had hired a private investigator to follow her husband as she suspected he was cheating on her. Sonia penned an “exposé” of the alleged affair, which she wrote after receiving  a report from her private investigator. She said the affair started on Valentine’s Day. According to her account, months went by and on the eve of their teenage son’s birthday, Matthew allegedly stayed up late making a cheesecake. The next day it was not in the fridge. The 2001 Miss South Africa second runner-up alleged that she found the Tupperware cake carrier at the home of her husband’s “mistress”. This  led to her publicising their marriage troubles. Her husband denied Sonia's  allegations. Months later, the mother of two, who is divorcing Matthew, has decided to turn what represented the fallout of her marriage into a business venture.
