Musician Bongekile “Babes Wodumo” Simelane has  been criticised for using her late husband’s social media account to promote her music. Babes' husband, musician Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo, died  on Christmas Eve after suffering  a stroke and  she has been using his social media account. She promoted her single Indoda no Sisi, featuring TNS, on her husband’s Facebook account  which has 1.4-million followers. TshisaLIVE reported that Babes’ sister and manager Nondumiso Simelane defended the gqom musician, saying  she had a right to use the platform. “She has every right to use her husband's Facebook account. Even my brother-in-law would not have had a problem with her using it. He was also promoting Babes' music on his social media, so that means this wouldn't have been a problem.” Robbie Malinga Junior  suffered  the same criticism in 2017 when he took over his father's Instagram account with more than 100,000 followers. This was after his father died in December 2017 and he had his mother’s blessing to go  ahead with it. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
