Deputy President David Mabuza was a no show at the two-day cabinet lekgotla  at Sefako Makgatho presidential guest house in Pretoria on Thursday. Confirming Mabuza’s absence, minister in the presidency Mondli Gungubele   said: “The deputy president has submitted his apology to the president. It’s only the president who can  do an evaluation of that, but  if he is sick, we cannot determine the frequency and the number of times he gets sick. “The deputy president has got no history of behaving like a truant or going awol. He is a deputy president  who has  respected his work and I  view him in that context and respect his apology on the basis of that history and the knowledge I have of him.” Mabuza,  while no longer  deputy president of the  ANC, remains  deputy president of the country and the leader of government business in parliament. His absence  has led to  speculation that President Cyril Ramaphosa  may announce changes to his cabinet soon and  Mabuza is making way for newly elected ANC deputy president Paul Mashatile, who is expected to be sworn in as a MP soon. Mashatile's move to parliament comes after Mabuza indicated his intention to resign as  deputy president. Resolutions taken at the  lekgotla will inform  Ramaphosa's  state-of-the-nation address next Thursday in Cape Town. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
