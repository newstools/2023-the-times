Johannesburg Water says its infrastructure is  performing better after  the recent power failure at the Eikenhof pump station which led to water outages in most parts of the city. Residents have not had water supplies from the weekend in some areas while others started experiencing  outages on Monday. Johannesburg Water spokesperson Puleng Mopeli said the Commando system was performing better on Tuesday afternoon than the day before. “Water inflow has increased at the Brixton reservoir zone while the supply in the Hursthill 1 and 2 areas has improved. “Although the Helderkruin reservoir and tower are back to normal operation, pending the load-shedding schedule, the Roodepoort and Randburg areas are  not operating optimally. There has been a slight improvement  in inflow at the Linden 1 reservoir, but the Linden tower is  strained,” Mopeli said. She said in the Eagles Nest and Aeroton areas,  water supply is back to normal, and suburbs such as Ormonde View and Nasrec, which did not have water on Tuesday morning, had  normal supply  by the afternoon. Mopeli said supply was restored by Tuesday evening in the Crown Gardens areas. She said the Parktown 2 system was stabilising and Johannesburg Water technicians predict the off-peak demand experienced during the night will boost the system to increase  supply. “Alternative water supply continues to be provided, with 26 roaming tankers servicing affected areas across the city. The Helen Joseph and Rahima Moosa Mother and Child hospitals have three tankers boosting supply, while nine roaming tankers are servicing the Brixton system areas. The Crown Gardens area has five roaming tankers and the Linden tower system has one. “The Roodepoort and Randburg areas have four roaming tankers and Klipfontein View also has four. Water tankers are being arranged for  Greenside and Emmarentia.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
