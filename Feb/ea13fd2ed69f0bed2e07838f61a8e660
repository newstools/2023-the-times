The  South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has dismissed fake news targeting job seekers that it is hiring 160,000 workers this year. This  after a job offer circulating on social media claimed the agency had a vacancy for people aged from 16 to 35. The fake post promised job seekers they would receive a salary of between R176,310 and  R207,681  a year, excluding benefits. “Please be aware of the  fake news making the rounds on social media,” said Sassa. “When in doubt, please go to your nearest Sassa office or call our customer care number. Direct people to our page for more information. Do not share your personal information with anyone.” Sassa warned the public against following or joining social media accounts  using the agency’s logo and information as their own. Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi advised people to verify information. “We are concerned about the increase in fake social media pages and groups spreading information about Sassa’s work. We will continue sharing Sassa job  vacancies on our official pages or in newspapers.” He also cautioned people about online scams claiming Sassa has a R700 grant, saying it does not exist.
