Zakes Bantwini has appealed to sport, arts and culture minister Nathi Mthethwa to help grow Mzansi's talents. The musician and businessman addressed the minister at Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport during a ceremony on Friday after he, Wouter Kellerman and Nomcebo Zikode received the Best Global Music Performance Award at the 65th annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, California, on Monday. The trio won for their hit song Bayethe. Zakes echoed the words of many South African artists who have raised their hands to help grow the arts here. The musician said the ceremony symbolised the great start many of the country's other artists  should experience. Against the backdrop of the state of the nation address (Sona), at which President Cyril Ramaphosa outlined plans for the country amid challenges, it was "amazing that the first person you are greeted by at the airport is OR Tambo, who sacrificed his life for us to be here today. We are indeed standing on the shoulders of giants", said Zakes. Going forward, he said he wanted to see the fruits of Mthethwa's department's budget. “We are saying that if the work is done right, we will not have to use a celebratory platform such as this to raise issues about the country. "We are trusting you, minister, we are trusting our politicians, we are trusting our business people and the media ... to [provide] this country with opportunities ... This Grammy marks a start, it speaks to someone from the township," he added.
