A 29-year-old man  suspected of being behind a string of business burglaries in Standerton in Mpumalanga was caught in the act on Wednesday morning when police responded swiftly to an alarm  that went off. The  security response team  informed the police  that  an alarm had been triggered in one of the business premises, and police swiftly attended to the call. “The suspect, believed to be behind a string of business burglaries in Standerton, was caught red-handed. He was reportedly found still damaging the air conditioners with the possibility of unlawfully gaining access to copper cables inside. The suspect was immediately arrested by  police on the scene,” police spokesperson Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said. He said Standerton has previously experienced business burglaries where suspects gained access  through the roof, and Wednesday morning's incident was no different. The suspect is due to appear at the Standerton District Court on Friday. “Further investigation will be conducted to ascertain if the suspect is involved in other incidents that were previously reported.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
