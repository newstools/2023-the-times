Mosuwe Molaba, 55,  a school bus driver who allegedly assaulted a 17-year-old pupil in the Free State,  has appeared in court and remains in custody. He  appeared briefly  in the Hoopstad magistrate's court  on Friday. His case was postponed to February 10 for a  bail application. Free State police spokesperson Capt Stephen Thakeng said the ANC Women’s League and  school pupils  protested  outside the court as proceedings got under way inside. Molaba was arrested after a video clip went viral, allegedly showing him assaulting and strangling a teenager in the bus. He was charged with assault and attempted murder, said Thakeng. The video was seemingly  taken by another pupil  on  the bus. It  shows the pupil  being kicked in  the stomach, punched and  it appears an attempt  was made to push him out  the bus.
