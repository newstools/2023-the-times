The dating space is often referred to as 'mjolo the pandemic' and most if not all people have had their fair share of mjolo stories that we either laugh about or take them as lessons and Miss Pru has hers. The music DJ took to her Twitter timeline in a thread going step by step in her past 'mjolo the pandemic' story and talking about an ex she dated for two years. "Once dated a guy who was a serial liar and a tech nerd. He once said he had a business trip to California but my sixth sense was telling me otherwise. He somehow called me with an international looking number but hai, khona into e-off! One day I after he called I drove to ekasi.” She didn't listen to that little voice that tells people "don't do it" and went on a hunt to prove her hunch right. "uMjita was chilling at his normal corner laughing out loud, you could see the back of his throat. Yaz I froze. I thought to myself that he’d lie about this anyway no matter how angry I got. He saw my car and I drove off in tears." In her mentions her followers had a good laugh at her story while some insisted she was the wrong one in Acrimony. "Wena how did you arrive in California by driving, " wrote one follower. "Problem nguwe umjita said he is going to California, why wud u follow yo man ko California... Wait until he is back in south africa,” added aother. Miss Pru said she eventually parted ways with the guy and the break-up story deserved a thread of its own.
