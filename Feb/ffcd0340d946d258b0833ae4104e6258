The  former mayor of the now defunct Ingwe municipality, Nomagugu Luzulane, accused of using  taxpayers' money to pay for the funeral of  former ANC Harry Gwala regional secretary Amos Zondi, has  claimed innocence. The Creighton-based municipality was amalgamated with KwaSani municipality to become the  Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma municipality. Luzulane appeared in the Durban commercial crimes court on Monday. The state  alleges she spent R71,000, with R10,000  for funeral grocery purchases at Donnybrook Spar on April 17 2012. It also alleges  she  used  the money under the pretext of  a  government social relief programme. She is alleged to have been in a romantic relationship with Zondi — a claim  she has denied. Luluzane, who is out on bail, was led in her testimony  by her lawyer Niven Rai. She said though she  attended Zondi's funeral, she  was not part of the team who  catered for mourners. “That is not true. My presence at the funeral was largely informed by my position as mayor and I was with the VIP,” she said. Luzulane  said the allegations  against her were “a political ploy”. .The case has been postponed to March 27. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
