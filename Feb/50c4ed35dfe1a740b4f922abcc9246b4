President Cyril Ramaphosa has  offered condolences to those affected by an earthquake in Turkey and Syria. The death toll is reported to have risen to more than 2,600 by Monday afternoon after an earthquake hit the two countries. Of those, 1,651 were killed  in 10 provinces in Turkey and more than 960 died in Syria. More than 12,000 people were injured in both countries. “Our nation and government are  saddened by the  loss of life in Turkey and Syria and  the vast damage to social and economic infrastructure with which the two governments and populations are now confronted,” Ramaphosa said. The  quake was reported as the biggest  “recorded in the history of the centre”, according to the head of Syria’s National Earthquake Centre Raed Ahmed. The earthquake measured at 7.8,  the first of such scale in Turkey since 1939. Ramaphosa  thanked humanitarian aid organisation Gift of the Givers for joining the response to the quake. “Our hearts go out to families who have lost loved ones or are searching for relatives and we wish injured survivors a full recovery.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
