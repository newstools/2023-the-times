The Gauteng education department on Monday  recommended that a grade 10 Nic Diederichs Technical High School pupil  captured on video beating a fellow grade 10 girl be expelled. The incident happened last month. The footage of the  assault went viral on social media. Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said  disciplinary proceedings were heard on Sunday, “The hearing resulted in a recommendation being made to our head of department  that the  [pupil] should be expelled from the school.” The head of department will make the final decision on the expulsion, he said. The video shows a girl and boy  approaching the victim  seated near other pupils at school. The boy is seen confronting the girl and as she stands and places her hands on her hips, the boy  hands what looks like a cellphone to his friend. He  hits the girl he was confronting over the head and she falls back. As she tries to retaliate, she is slapped numerous times on the head by the boy. The boy was suspended pending  disciplinary proceedings. Gauteng education MEC Matome Chiloane  condemned  misconduct by pupils against others. “Learner ill-discipline in our schools will be met with consequences. We also plead with parents to assist in enforcing discipline on their children in and outside  school,” Chiloane said. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
