A “staggering increase in attacks” has seen  72 MyCiTi passenger buses  stoned and damaged over the past three months in Cape Town. The buses operate on 46 routes  in the city. “We have seen a staggering increase in attacks on our buses — in particular along the N2 Express routes serving passengers from Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha,”  urban mobility MMC  Rob Quintas said on Thursday. “The  affect on commuters  is devastating. We cannot operate buses with smashed windows and must  withdraw the bus from service. That means  the trips scheduled for that  bus are missed or delayed for as long as the bus is in for repairs. Commuters   don’t arrive at work or school on time and there are long queues at stations and stops because the full fleet is not operational due to vandalism.” The  buses were stoned between November 1 and January 31. Damaged vehicles are taken out of service for up to two days  to replace broken windows and windshields  at a cost of R7,000 to R10,000 each, depending on the size. An 18m  bus transporting 120 passengers at a time usually  made three trips during the morning commuter peak period on the N2 Express routes — potentially affecting up to 360 passengers from Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha if it was damaged and withdrawn for repairs during that time. “Vandalism is a  problem. The cost to replace and repair the damage to our MyCiTi fleet is shocking. Then there is the indirect cost to commuters — the residents who lose out on an income because they are late for work or spend hours longer  commuting, waiting in queues, because we do not have enough buses to transport them,” said Quintas. Communities were urged to report the perpetrators to the police or city. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
