DJ Zinhle's attendance at  last week's memorial service for her former partner, rapper Kiernan “AKA” Forbes,  has sparked debate, with some claiming she should have skipped the event and others saying she was there for daughter Kairo. AKA was assassinated outside a popular Florida Road, Durban restaurant  on February 10. Celebrity chef and author Tebello “Tibz” Motsoane was also killed in the shooting. AKA and Zinhle have a daughter together,  and the DJ was at her child's side at the memorial service for her father on Friday. While some welcomed Zinhle's presence, others claimed “cultural practices” should have prevented her from attending. Many said she was  there for Kairo and should be allowed to comfort her child. Musician and actor Kabomo launched a scathing attack on DJ Zinhle's critics, telling them to leave her alone. “Leave DJ Zinhle alone you stupid, insensitive, backwards, glycerine smelling, sandals with socks wearing, pineapple skin eating idiots,” he said. Radio host Hulisani Ravele said those who were attacking the DJ had likely come from broken homes. “They grew up in environments with constant fighting and dysfunction which became their norm, their benchmark. Anything that strays from that is wrong and beyond reach as it invalidates them and challenges the notion that things could be different if they were willing to heal and learn,” she said. She said she grew up in such an environment but chose to break free of it. “It’s too easy to blame the past rather than name the pain, do the work and heal,” she said. Zinhle took to Instagram last week to thank her followers for their support and asked them to continue praying for Kairo. “Kairo is feeling pretty today. Thank you for your love and prayers. I am holding Kairo's hand throughout. Thank you for your messages. Please don't stop praying for my child. God bless you.”
