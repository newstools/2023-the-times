Tweeps have dug up an interview of slain rapper AKA talking about how Nota Baloyi betrayed him. Meanwhile, the former music exec is seeking justice and spreading conspiracies about the rapper’s assassination on social media. Kiernan “AKA” Forbes was gunned down outside a popular restaurant in Durban on Friday evening in a shooting that also resulted in the death of lifelong friend Tebello “Tibz” Motsoane, a chef and author. Since AKA’s passing, Nota has alleged AKA was taken to Durban for him to be killed. He has pinned former Dream Team member Lusasa “Saso” Ngcobo, Don Design, DJ Benny Maverick and other men he was last seen with as suspects. Nota's timeline has also been flooded with his tributes to AKA and desire to see his murderer “pay the ultimate price of hell on earth”. Meanwhile, AKA’s sit-down on the Sobering Podcast has since gone viral. In the interview the rapper speaks of how Nota double-crossed him. “I haven’t bumped into Nota. There's some real personal sh*t that he did the day after Anele passed. He flew to Cape Town and was there with me and my family, spent time with the family, with my mom in the kitchen and me crying my eyes out on the coach and all that stuff ... then he came back and he used all of that information that he gained as a friend to try to destroy me,” he said. Watch the video below: Nota’s speculations about who ordered the hit on AKA have landed him in hot water. The controversial social media user was recently summoned by AmaZulu Football Club chairperson Sandile Zungu's legal representatives, who ordered him to apologise for alleging Sandile threatened the lives of AKA and his friends. In his apology Nota implicated the minister of police in the crime. “Apologies ... my prime suspect the Minister of Police!” he wrote.
