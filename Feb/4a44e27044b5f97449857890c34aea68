Convicted murderer Flavio Hlabangwane will have to wait another month  to learn his fate after  his trial was postponed on Friday. The Johannesburg high court last week found Hlabangwane, 28, guilty of  murder, defeating the ends of justice and violating a corpse. He was arrested in November 2021 after  body parts of his girlfriend Tshepang Pitse were found in his fridge. The discovery was made by his new girlfriend who raised the alarm with neighbours and  police. Hlabangwane  confessed to killing  Pitse, saying he plotted to do so after discovering she had been unfaithful to him. TimesLIVE understands Pitse and Hlabangwane  were related. After a brief back-and-forth between the state and defence, judge Cassim Ismail Moosa postponed the matter to March 22 for pre-sentencing. This is to allow  probation officers time to prepare their reports and finish interviewing Hlabangwane's family as well as that of the victim. If  the evidence is ready on that day,  the sentence will  probably be handed down the same week, Moosa  said. Hlabangwane, wearing a green check shirt and sporting  dreadlocks, mostly kept his head down during  proceedings. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to theÂ Sunday Times.
