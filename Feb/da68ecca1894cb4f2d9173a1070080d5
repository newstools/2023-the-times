Ten people were shot dead in two villages in the  Bhityi area, near Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, on Wednesday night. Three were  killed at Thantseka village near Bumbane. Traditional leader Nkosi Mfundo Mtirara said seven others were killed in Qunu. Bhityi and Qunu are  13km apart. “It is believed the attack first started at Thantseka at about 8pm on Wednesday and later it was here at Qunu. The shooting incident at Qunu happened at about 11.40pm. All the seven bodies were in one house and this suggested that they are of one family,” Mtirara said. He  said it was not known if the two incidents were related. Community members  said they feared for their lives. This incident comes after the shooting of seven family members at Thantseka last year. This is a developing story. DispatchLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
