Police have arrested a suspected hijacker at a Westville, Durban, home and seized four allegedly stolen vehicles, a jet ski, rifles and a police cap. Police spokesperson Col Robert Netshiunda said the 28-year-old suspect was nabbed by members of the tactical response team  in connection with  a spate of hijackings in Durban and surrounding areas. He said the team executed a search warrant and found a white Hyundai  i20  reportedly stolen in  Durban central, a grey Ford Ranger stolen in Brighton Beach in September 2021 and two Toyota Fortuners — one white and the other gold —  allegedly stolen in Westville and Alexander Road  in April and May 2022. “The suspect was also found in possession of a jet ski  with the manufacturer's plates  filed off,” said Netshiunda. Police  found three rifles, two handguns and ammunition. The firearms would  be taken for ballistic testing to ascertain if they were  used in the commission of crime. The suspect is expected to appear in court soon. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
