Police were maintaining high visibility and were on high alert in Westbury, Johannesburg, on Monday after two people were killed and 11 others attacked  at the  weekend. This comes in the wake of an alleged gang leader's  murder last week on Thursday. Keenan Ebrahim was  shot dead in an apparent hit while driving in Constantia Kloof. The 38-year-old was alleged to have been the leader of the  Fast Guns gang. Since then, the area has been described as “volatile” and a “no-go zone”, with entities  such as City Power  withdrawing services. Its workers  were  later able to return with police and Johannesburg metro police escorts. In recent days there was an  attack on a police reservist at Langlaagte, whose house was shot at. “So they went and shot in his place. [In a separate incident] four people were injured, one  died,” said Sophiatown police station commander Brig Bonginkosi Ndebele. “So far it's six incidents. Two  died [and] 11 attempted [murders].” Police insisted  many officers were on the ground, with some  deployed to do foot patrols. Metro police spokesperson Xolani Fihla confirmed  they were maintaining visibility in the area since last year. “We have had constant deployment since last year in Westbury. There's a dedicated team that does visible policing within the area,” he told TimesLIVE. He confirmed  shootings suspected to be gang-related in recent days. He  said it has been “a tense period” since Ebrahim's  killing. “We are [also] making sure  we heighten our visibility, officers are on high alert regarding  criminal activities within the area and  assisting other departments in the city to continue  their  operations,” he said. TimesLIVE spoke to ward councillors in the area who were reluctant to  comment  for fear of their safety.
