The Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) this week said it was  “facing an enormous battle” in trying to save the city's traffic lights and signal poles from theft and vandalism, with 26  intersections affected in January alone. The JRA raised concern at the “alarming increase” in the theft and vandalism of the lights, especially in the past year. It said that over the past four years, 531 of the city's 2,028 signalised traffic intersections have been vandalised, costing R28.1m to replace. “In the past year [January 2022 to January 2023], this figure increased by 172, with  January 2023 alone reflecting theft and vandalism at 26 signalised intersections. “The hardest hit area [is] the inner city [which accounts] for 60% of cases,” JRA said. Thugs were using load-shedding as a cover to steal copper wire at the intersections without fear of electrocution, JRA added. Targeted hotspots in the inner city include: In Soweto, these roads are targeted: In Roodepoort, the following intersections are targeted: JRA acting CEO Louis Nel said  theft and vandalism “not only disrupt the working of  signals which are essential services, but also jeopardise public safety. “The  result is a negative drain on the city's economy with traffic congestion and unproductive, frustrated commuters, as well as a possible increase in  collisions. “The very furniture  intended to prevent accidents  ends up being sold to illegal scrap metal dealers for almost nothing,” he said. The JRA said it was working with City Power, the JMPD, SAPS and security companies “to ensure a more effective response” to the issue.
