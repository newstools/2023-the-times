In the post Stephanie said she had while she did not plan to go for the audition, “someone near and dear” to her convinced her to give it a shot — and she aced it. “Getting back to work after a baby is a challenge for anyone, but getting back to being in front of the camera has been the greatest battle for me. “I still sometimes feel like a stranger in my own body (and mind) but this is a big one for me; not for the obvious reason but because I really didn’t plan to do this audition or any auditions, any time soon, but I did it anyway because I’m constantly fighting against the desire to give up on myself,” she wrote. Stephanie went on to recall her first day back at work, encouraging herself not to give up. “Today was tough, almost had a meltdown at this fitting. What started out as excitement quickly turned into frustration, and I almost wanted to give up again. What’s important is that I didn’t. “Everyone has a different postpartum journey that lasts for however long it lasts. What’s important is that you show up for yourself, because you’re a freaking masterpiece. So, hard as it may be, I will continue to show up because I deserve to.
