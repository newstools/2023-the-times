A Free State bus driver allegedly caught on camera assaulting a pupil  has been arrested. The  pupil was assaulted and strangled  in Hoopstad on Monday and the driver is facing charges of common assault and attempted murder. Provincial police spokesperson Capt Stephen Thakeng said it is alleged that on Monday at about 7am, a 17-year-old  was waiting with other pupils at a bus stop in Oranjekuil farm, Hoopstad. The bus arrived, stopped and the  driver got off. He was holding a list and started to call the names of  pupils until the 17-year-old was the only one left. “He [the pupil] decided to enter the bus to ask the  driver why he could not   use the school bus. Apparently, the  driver started to assault him, kick him and strangled this boy,” said Thakeng. The teenager tried to fight back but  was overpowered. “The boy ultimately   reported the incident to his mother. He sustained internal injuries, bruises on his face and could not sleep as a result,” said Thakeng. The driver was initially charged with common assault  by Hoopstad police but it was reviewed after consultation with prosecution authorities based on  new evidence in  a video clip. The 56-year-old suspect will appear at the Hoopstad magistrate's court on Friday. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
