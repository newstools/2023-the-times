Gail and Kabelo Mabalane marked a milestone in their union on Thursday. The two stars, who have been together for 12 years and have two children together, took to their Instagram timeline sharing images from their wedding day and penning heartfelt messages to each other on their social media in celebration of their love. In Kabelo's post the former Kwaito artist turned pastor reflected on their love journey, speaking of how he had come to perceive love and accept that it will never be perfect. “You will not find a love that is perfect, but you will find a love that reminds you that goodness exists. This love, it will inject honey into the soul of you, it will feel like warmth has cracked within your bones. And you will see how it teaches  you, and fights for you, and stays to weather the storms by your side. “You will be reminded that there is connection in a world that often chooses distance over depth. You will be reminded that there is hope to be found pouring from the fingertips of another human being, tucked between the layers of the things you have yet to discover about them. No, you will not find a love that is perfect, but you will find a love that is light, that isn't heavy to carry, that does not weigh down the core of you. Happy 10-year anniversary my skat Gail Mabalane. Let’s keep dancing to the unforced rhythms of His Grace,” he wrote. Gail also took to her timeline professing her love for her hubby. “10 years today my skat. Look at God! Time does fly when you’re having fun. Thank you for the best 10 years. I love you stukkend! Cheers to the next 10, and beyond. To failing forward. To our best years which are still ahead of us. Happy Anniversary.”
