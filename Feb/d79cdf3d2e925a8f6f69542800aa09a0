Nozipho Sibiya, popularly known as Nozi, flashed back to her show-stopping performance from Idols SA, appreciating Somizi for believing in her. The season 18 semifinalist received a standing ovation from the audience and judges when she sang Jennifer Hudson's Giving Myself. JR said the show should shut down, suggesting she was worthy of being crowned the winner. Thembi Seete was brought to tears, saying Nozi should remain vulnerable because of how it affected her work, and Somizi jumped on stage to laud her for her talent. The singer took to her timeline on Monday to express what that moment felt like for her, saying she would never forget it. “This moment I will cherish forever. The way ngikuthanda ngayo Somizi,” she wrote. Nozi's performance even got her a stamp of approval from Jennifer herself, who shared a clip of her performance on her Twitter timeline with the caption: “OK I’m a little late, but y'all need to hear this.  Nozi on Idols SA performed my song Giving Myself. If I was there she would have caught a shoe. She did that.” Though Nozi may not have taken the crown on Idols SA, she told TshisaLIVE she is here to stay after signing to Kalawa Jazmee. “I feel good. I am so happy Thapelo won. We always said his win is my win. He deserves it. We give God the Glory. It's all timing. Everything works together for those who wait and believe in God.” she said. The singer said she plans to pursue any genre that's soulful. “I'm so happy I got this far. I am not going anywhere. People will be seeing more of my face and hearing my music. I want to do any genre that speaks to the soul. I don't want to be picky. I'm just a soulful person and I speak to people in that manner.”
