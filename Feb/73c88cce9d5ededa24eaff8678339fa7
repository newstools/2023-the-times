Former KwaZulu-Natal premier Sihle Zikalala  says he is not bitter about the ANC provincial elective conference results. Zikalala resigned recently as a member of the KwaZulu-Natal executive and MPL to  become an MP. Speaking on Newzroom Afrika, Zikalala said the decision to  resign came after a discussion with ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula and the provincial leadership where the party decided he  should move to the National Assembly. “I intended to resign as  premier [after the conference], which I engaged the leadership of the ANC [on] and it was reluctant to accept that. “We had a discussion and that  culminated to a point I will resign as premier but be available to serve as  MEC so that it does not seem like I'm just leaving bitter. I wasn't bitter at all.” Zikalala said it is the responsibility of all ANC cadres to serve where they are deployed. He couldn't say when he would  be sworn in as an MP as it depends on the chief whip and presiding officers. The ANC  has not  specified what role Zikalala will play at national level, but  has said  it is confident  he will “sustain and accelerate the agenda of the national democratic revolution”. “This resignation has necessitated the reconfiguration of the provincial executive committee. The premier will introduce the new MEC once the ANC has finalised its deployment process and completed consultations with structures of the ANC. “The ANC salutes  Zikalala for serving the organisation and the people of  the province with distinction. Many comrades and the people of  the province will attest to his commitment as he carried out his responsibilities as deployed by the ANC,” it said.
