Lynn Forbes has gushed over her son's girlfriend Nadia Nakai for bringing out the best in him. Rapper Kiernan “AKA” Forbes was gunned down outside a popular Durban restaurant earlier this month. Celebrity chef and author Tebello “Tibz” Motsoane was also killed in the shooting. The suspects have not been apprehended. AKA and Nadia went public about their relationship in March 2022 when they posted a video of them sharing a kiss while at Orthodox VIP Lounge in Johannesburg. Taking to her Instagram timeline on Sunday, Lynn shared moments  between the rappers when AKA was still alive. “I am forever indebted to you for the way you love and respect my son to this day. You showed him what real love and respect is and you brought out the absolute best in him. “Kiernan was born with love, raised in love, gave love to so many and all he wanted in return was to be loved and respected in the same way. You gave that to him and he died surrounded by love. Thank you,” she wrote. Taking to the podium at the memorial service held at the Sandton Convention Centre for AKA, Lynn said through her late son she had gained two daughters. “I want to celebrate at this time Zinhle and Nadia. This is not a normal situation for most people,” she said. “Sometimes I don't do Twitter but when I go there sometimes and I find all these things, I think, 'Come on people, it's all love over here. I aimed to have two sons but what I've gained are three daughters. Britney, Nadia and Zinhle. And forever, both of you, though Kiernan is not around any more, you are always welcome and you will always be my daughters. "And I don't care what anybody says on social media about you. They don't matter. You matter because I love you.” Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
