A debate around homemade booze resurfaced this week when a KwaZulu-Natal man was arrested with more than 127,000 alcohol bottle caps at Durban’s King Shaka International Airport. Xolani Demistrose Mlaba, 41, was arrested travelling  from Beijing, China, and is alleged to have manufactured spirit alcohol in his Umlazi house. According to a source, Mlaba allegedly  offered a police officer a R10,000 bribe  for the release of his cargo from the cargo terminal. Instead he was arrested for alleged corruption and  possession of illicit goods. and his cargo confiscated. When police searched his home, they found an alleged “alcohol-manufacturing factory”. “There were more than 30  20l drums connected by  pipes to about 10 barrels.  There were a lot of empty bottles from different alcohol brands. The bottles were clean. It was understood  alcohol manufacturers would dispose of the bottles and he would seal them with the caps he went to buy in China. Experts have warned of the dangers of homemade alcohol,  saying the use of embalming fluid to increase potency can be life-threatening. Dangerously high alcohol content, contamination during production and toxic ingredients like methanol and methylated spirits can also lead to poisoning.
