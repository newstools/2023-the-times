The plan to partially privatise national airline  SAA is in trouble because the  competition regulator may not approve the deal, news website Semafor reported on Thursday. In 2021 government signed a deal with the Takatso Consortium to sell a majority stake in the state-owned carrier to the consortium, which had promised to invest more than R3bn  to revive the airline. The involvement of Global Airways, which is part of the consortium and owns the regional airline Lift, could pose a market consolidation risk and is a point of concern for  authorities at  the Competition Commission, Semafor said. The competition watchdog has started investigating the possibility  the new company would stifle competition if the deal goes through, Semafor reported, citing officials at the ministries of finance and public enterprises, and an official at the  chosen consortium. The regulator did not respond to Reuters' request for comment late on Thursday.
