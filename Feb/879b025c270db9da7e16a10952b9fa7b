Babes Wodumo's manager and sister Nondumiso Simelane has defended the musician against trolls questioning why she uses her late husband Mampintsha's social media accounts. Big Nuz member Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo died on December 24 after a minor stroke, and many on social media have been questioning how and why his social media accounts have remained active. Babes recently took to Mampintsha's social accounts  to promote her single Indoda no SIsi featuring TNS before launching it on Friday. Responding to trolls, Nondumiso said Babes had every right to use the platforms as her husband would have not had any issues with this. “It's her husband's account. She has every right to use her husband's Facebook account. It's not her boyfriend's or baby daddy but  that of her husband so she can use it. She has that right. Even my brother-in-law would not have had a problem with her using it. He was  promoting Babes music on his social media so  means this wouldn't have been a problem,” she told TshisaLIVE. Babes is not the first celebrity to use  the account of  a deceased person. Robbie Malinga Junior took over his fathers Instagram account with more than  100,000 followers after he died in December 2017, and had his mother’s blessing to go forward with it. Weighing in on the matter, media personality Mpho Maboi said: “People whose handles continue to tweet posthumously are creepy. Like why are we tweeting on behalf of the dead? It’s almost as cringe as parents who IG for their babies and respond to themselves.”
