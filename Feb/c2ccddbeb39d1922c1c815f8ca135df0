Gauteng premier Panyaza Lesufi  says  resident are  not “difficult” but want public representatives to do their work. “They are just asking all of us  to do one thing and one thing only, to do our work. To do our work within budget  without misusing public funds.” Lesufi was speaking at the state of the province address, where he outlined  plans  and initiatives to drive service delivery. If government did its work there would be no need for  residents to pay for private medical aid and  would  use the public health system. “If we do our work there will be no need for residents to pay their hard-earned money for private education, they will use the public education system. “If we do our work there will be no need for our people to pay for their own CCTVs, alarms, burglar doors [and] private security guards because the police will be policing our communities.” He added if government  did its duty there would be no need for residents to worry about the cost of fuel as they would opt for dependable public transport. “If we do our work our people would not to have pay for generators, solar panels, inverters because there will be no load-shedding.” Lesufi added that as long as members of the legislature did not trust and use public services  they were not doing their job. “As long as all of us  are not using state schools, it means we are not doing our work. “As long as all of us  are not using public hospitals,  we are not doing our work. “As long as all of us  are not using public transport it  means we are not doing our work.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
