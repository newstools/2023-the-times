Defending aQuelle Midmar Mile men’s champion Connor Buck cruised to another  win in the 50th edition of the race on Sunday. The 20-year old open water swimmer (17:39) finished almost a minute ahead of runner-up Henre Louw (18:34) at Midmar Dam, in the  KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. An ecstatic Buck told TimesLIVE he was proud of defending his title. “I think it’s the fastest time I’ve ever done in the Midmar Dam so I’m very happy with my performance.” Buck said he was  looking ahead to the qualification for the World Athletic Championships  in Japan. Meanwhile, world 10km champion Sharon van Rouwendaal won the women’s edition. Reflecting on her experience of the race, Van Rouwendaal said she was glad to  get the invite to the race. “It was also nice to race in one straight line, but then I had some problems to see where the finish was because there were white tents everywhere,” she said. “I had to focus until the end. I controlled it from the middle of the race. I just wanted to win the Midmar.” The most heartwarming moment came when  90-year old Mike Arbuthnot maintained his  long participation in the race. Arbuthnot is one of the founders of the race and remains the only swimmer to have officially competed in all 50 races since 1974. “Humbling is the word to describe how I feel at seeing the growth of an event like this from where it was back in my day,” he told TimesLIVE. Arbuthnot also received a certificate of appreciation. See more pictures from the race here: TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
