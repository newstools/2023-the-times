The Hawks have appealed for help to trace bodies of victims of apartheid crimes that were never recovered. They have asked  members of the public, possible witnesses and relatives of the victims to come forward with information. On Saturday police spokesperson Brig Thandi Mbambo said such information would help solve apartheid crimes revealed to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) but never solved. She said most victims, whose deaths the Hawks' serious organised crime investigation team is trying to solve, “reportedly committed suicide while in detention and others were allegedly shot while escaping from lawful custody”. From Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the North West they include:  Victims from the Karoo region, which covers the Free State and Northern Cape, include: Victims from the Eastern Cape region include: Those from the Western Cape include: Victims whose bodies were not recovered include: Anyone with any information about the deceased is requested to contact Col MB Nkuna on 071-330-2219 or alternately e-mail MalepoF@saps.gov.za.
