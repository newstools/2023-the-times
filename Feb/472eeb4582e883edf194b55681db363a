There were emotional scenes at Johannesburg's OR Tambo and Cape Town international airports on Saturday when Gift of the Givers and SAPS search-and-rescue teams arrived home from Türkiye. The teams were dispatched after the devastating earthquakes there and in Syria that have so far claimed more than 40,000 lives. They were greeted by families and friends, as well as members of the public who handed out flowers and well wishes. At a press conference after their arrival, the Turkish embassy praised South Africa for its response to the tragedy, as did national police commissioner Gen Fannie Masemola, highlighting the rescue of a 90-year-old woman. In turn, Gift of the Givers praised Turkish authorities for their slick handling of rescue operations. Speaking to Newzroom Afrika at Cape Town International Airport, a doctor who was dispatched to the country said though he was happy to be home, he was sad to leave the people of Türkiye. “We did our best in trying conditions, but that's what we do and I would do it again,” he said. Another rescue team member who spoke to the news channel described the experience as “long, cold, hard and devastating”. Welcoming the teams, Cape Town premier Alan Winde said: “I commend Gift of the Givers for the work they do here at home and abroad in times of desperate need. The work you do is outstanding. The NGO is flying our flag high. These women and men who put their hands up when the call came for help are doing us proud. You are heroes, not just to us, but to the Turkish people you helped too." He added that those involved had made their families, the Western Cape and South Africa proud through their selflessness and risking their safety to help those in need.
