Unathi Nkayi and co-host Justin Toerien have hung up their mics at community radio station Star 91.9 FM. The pair have hosted The All Star Drive daily between three to six pm for 10 months. Unathi and Justin  released a joint statement on their Instagram timelines. “February serves as our last month as co-hosts of The All Star Drive on @star919fm We’ve had a great year together with you on air and on the gram and we’re very grateful for the wonderful moments we’ve shared with you. “We’ve decided not to extend our contracts and wish the station all the best. Stay blessed South Aaaa we love you,” read the statement. After being fired from Kaya FM, Unathi announced her return to the airwaves early last year on Instagram. In a statement shared with TshisaLIVE, Unathi expressed how she was anticipating venturing into a new radio format as she  was about to join the community radio station. “I am looking forward to a fresh new format of radio that I have never before attempted. To be able to speak to my community, from my community, and for my community — priceless! Being able to speak to a multicultural community is also something that I’m truly excited about because that’s the heart of radio — the heart of Joburg,” she said. “I’m so excited about this new chapter and definitely ready for the wild ride that is going to be the All-Star Drive.” “Expect loud, funny, passionate, bold — oh and did I mention loud? We are eager to make magic on the airwaves and guarantee a good laugh ... all the way home,” Justin said. Unathi was fired from Kaya 959 late last year after an alleged argument between her and colleague Sizwe Dhlomo. “Unathi Nkayi’s contract has ended prematurely due to certain conduct that rendered the relationship intolerable going forward. Kaya 959 can confirm certain incidents occurred which resulted in the breakdown of trust between the two parties,” read the station’s official statement.
