Free State education MEC Dr Tate Makgoe has called for the suspension and  banning of a transport driver who was recorded allegedly assaulting a pupil in a bus on Monday. In a video that has gone viral, the driver, who the Free State education department said is 56 years old, is allegedly seen physically abusing a  learner in a bus full of other pupils. The driver  allegedly kicked the pupil in his stomach, hit and  and punched him and  tried to push him out of the bus. Young pupils, who seem to be in lower grades,  cried throughout the ordeal while older  students were heard in the background trying to stop the driver from  assaulting the pupil. The department has identified the child as a 17-year-old grade 12 pupil from Hanover Farm  near Bulfontein, in Lejweleputswa district. “I am  disgusted by this physical and emotional abuse of the pupil and others who witnessed the brutality. This man must be permanently barred from working with our children,” Makgoe said. “We have instructed the transport owner to immediately suspend the driver,” He said the incident has  been reported to the department of social development, which is the custodian of the Children’s Act, and said  police are investigatinge. Psychosocial support and counselling will be provided to the pupils who were on the bus. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
