While some women are doing endless squats to get that perfectly shaped derrière, Faith Nketsi misses her old jeans before she became a momma. Taking to her Twitter timeline on Tuesday, the reality TV star and mom of one said she lost weight but that one area is not going anywhere. “I truly love my body né, but after a baby, I was left with a bigger butt and no matter how much I lose weight it’s not going anywhere . That time I miss my old jeans so much,” she  her posted. Faith announced the arrival of baby Sky by sharing an image of herself with her baby and a pregnancy photo shoot on her social media timeline a  few months ago. At the exclusive premiere of her reality show, Faith's mother Linky Modise, affectionately known as Mama Linky, told TshisaLIVE pregnancies were meant to be kept secret. “She was blessed with a bundle of joy. She's a new mom ... We thank you  South Africa for respecting her privacy. You know she wanted to protect the sanctity of her pregnancy due to our cultural and traditional beliefs. All Africans know that. She went through that peacefully, happily [and is] growing into motherhood,” she said. After her show's  airing, she thanked people who respected her choice to keep her pregnancy private. “Just like that! That is it from me with my pregnancy journey and I’d like to thank you guys so much, not only for respecting my decision to keep it private, but also for accepting and loving me and baby Sky.” Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
