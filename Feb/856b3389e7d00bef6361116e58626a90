A Grammy win has catapulted Wouter Kellerman, Zakes Bantwini and Nomcebo Zikode's hit song Bayethe on to many South African playlists. The song won the trio the Best Global Music Performance award at the 65th annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, California in the early hours on Monday. In an acceptance speech, Zakes said the award was for Africa. “I want to say we’re coming from Africa, from South Africa. And this moment we’re here for anybody who is in Africa just proves and affirms every dream is valid. “I want to say thank you very much to the (Recording) Academy. To each and every one and for every child in the ghetto, in the village, know it’s possible.” Taking to social media, he thanked all those who supported him on his journey and praised God for the win. The win had many confessing  they had not heard the song before, while those who had said the Grammy was well-deserved. Nomcebo broke into a short a cappella version of Jerusalema before her acceptance speech and recounted her journey to winning a Grammy award. “Thank you so much to God. You know I once gave the world a song [Jerusalema] that took the world by storm. The world that got us together, but I didn’t get this nomination or this award. “But God was saying to me, ‘Don’t worry my daughter, I will give you Bayethe. Thank you so much to my mom. Thank you so much to my husband, Selwyn Fraser. Believe me, this is yours. Your support is amazing. Thank you so much to all my team. Thank you.” Wouter shared the moment he and his fellow South Africans learnt they had won and dedicated the win to the whole of South Africa. “We won the Grammy for the Best Global Music Performance for our song Bayethe. Thank so much to everybody for all the support. This is for the whole of South Africa.”
