Tumisho Masha has taken  the lead role in Fences,  the star-studded local adaptation of the classic American play by  August Wilson, after Dr John  Kani stepped down due to ill health. Masha plays  Troy Maxson, alongside Khutjo Green who plays his wife Rose. The cast also features Lunga Radebe as Jim Bono, Atandwa Kani as  Troy’s son Cory, Sbusiso Mamba as  Gabriel and Hlomla Dandala as  Lyons, Troy’s son from a previous relationship. John Kani is the co-producer of the play. “It is with great sadness that I have to announce that I will be stepping down from the role of Troy in August Wilson’s Fences. It is a role I have long dreamed of playing. However, a bout of vertigo and the  imbalance  it causes is precluding me from stepping on stage in this demanding role,” Kani said. “I will, however, continue to play a significant role as co-producer and continue to be part of the rehearsals, working closely with the director and the cast. “I am delighted to advise that the director has chosen the highly talented and experienced actor Tumisho Masha to succeed me in the role.” The play is set in the 1950s during the  civil rights movement. It touches on issues of race, the African American experience, family and betrayal, among other things. Masha’s character Troy is a former  baseball player who could not make it to the major leagues due to his race. An ex-convict and now a garbage collector, he tries to balance his family life and the struggles of being a black man in a segregated America. His relationship with his son Cory  is complicated due to his disapproval of him wanting to play baseball instead of finding work. Fences is playing at the Joburg Theatre from February 2-28 Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
