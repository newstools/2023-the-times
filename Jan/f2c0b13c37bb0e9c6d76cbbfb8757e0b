An Iranian  flying instructor was one of two people  killed when a light aircraft crashed in the south of Johannesburg on Sunday. The Iranian embassy  confirmed to TimesLIVE on Monday that Arian Assad, 28, died in the  crash. “He was not a passenger on the plane. He was a pilot instructor,” the embassy said.  He had been living in South Africa for five years. The aircraft was on a training flight when it crashed at Nasrec near the FNB stadium. According to the South African Civil Aviation Authority (Sacaa), the incident happened at about 9am. According to the embassy, Assad and the student pilot were flying an aircraft which had mechanical problems in the past. The problems were allegedly fixed numerous times. "[The aircraft] was repaired again only last week,” the embassy said. Assad's body was being sent home. He had been married for only 10 months. “The embassy has started its activities in repatriating his body. The embassy is following up with the relevant authorities on the cause of the crash.” According to  Sacaa, the aircraft  departed from Grand Central Airport  on a training flight  and was scheduled to land  at the same airport. “The aircraft  sustained substantial damage. The crash was reported by the Aeronautical Rescue Co-ordination Centre  to the Accident and Incident Investigation Division,” it said. A preliminary report will be issued within 30 days from the day of the accident. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
