The KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) says the province has seen a sharp decrease in road  accidents so far this festive season. RTI spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu said as of Tuesday, the province had reported a 13% decrease in  crashes and a 10% decrease in fatalities compared with January 3 last year. “The festive season is not yet over and the figures will be updated   as they  change daily. There is [still] a lot of activity on our roads,”  said Mngomezulu. KZN transport department spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane told TimesLIVE  the department  would issue a statement on Tuesday. Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube last week urged motorists to be  vigilant due to the increased  traffic volumes. She said about 140 people had died on KZN roads since the start of the festive season. This included 18 people  killed  in three  crashes in northern  KZN  over the December 16  long weekend. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
