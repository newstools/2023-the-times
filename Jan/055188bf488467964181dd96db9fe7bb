Retail group Pick n Pay has clapped back at a TikTok content creator mocking men for using a Smart Shopper card to do groceries. The content creator, in a now-viral video, joked that she found men who use a smart shopper card to do groceries “embarrassing”. “Am I the only person who finds it embarrassing when a guy has a smart shopper card? Imagine now I am at Pick n Pay with my boyfriend and before he pays, he takes out a Smart Shopper card ... that's so embarrassing,” she said, laughing. In a cheeky response, Pick n Pay said not having a Smart Shopper card and paying the full price was a “red flag”. Pick n Pay Smart Shopper is a loyalty programme that rewards customers for shopping at the store. “Imagine your boyfriend not being smart, not having a Smart Shopper card and paying full price. How embarrassing,” said the retail group. Taking a dig at the content creator's comments, Pick n Pay said it would reward “smart boyfriends” with R500 in  points. “If you’re a smart boyfriend, comment below and you could win R500 in Smart Shopper points. 10 smart boyfriends stand a chance to win R500 in Smart Shopper points each! Let's go.” Tito Mboweni hit maker, rapper Cassper Nyovest also weighed in, saying: “That’s why it’s called a Smart Shopper card.” Here's a snapshot of some of the reactions to the video.
