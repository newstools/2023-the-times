The community of Eldorado Park, Johannesburg, is living  in fear  after a  man  was shot dead  at the weekend. The police are investigating a case of murder after the shooting, which was reportedly carried out by three  men. “It alleged that on January 22  two men were sitting in a car at Eldorado Park when three unknown coloured men accosted them and started shooting,” Gauteng police spokesperson Col Dimakatso Sello said. “The two  ran away in different directions, but one of them sustained multiple gunshot wounds while the other survived without injury.” The suspects were reportedly seen driving away in a silver grey microbus. Community activist Dereleen James said killings have increased since mid-2022. “It’s reached a point where it's daily. We have sent a memorandum  to the police and the premier. “We had a 23-year-old girl  murdered. Yesterday [Sunday] we had a 26-year-old killed. The complaints were so that we don’t get to a point where it is happening daily. “We asked the police for  specialised interventions. It's unconventional times in our community. The community is suffering, we can’t walk in the streets,” said James. The community has  protested and camped outside a police station  to no avail, she said. “There is no intelligence being gathered. There’s no will from government to address  crime in our area. It’s not just at night, [but also] in the morning and during the day. “We feel traumatised because people  don't have an opportunity to heal. Every day we hear the sound of  gunfire.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
