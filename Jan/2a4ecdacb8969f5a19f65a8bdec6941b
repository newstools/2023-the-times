Gqom sensation Babes Wodumo is said to be cooking up something in studio. Music producer and club DJ Nkazimulo “TNS” Ngema took to his Facebook timeline to reveal the recently widowed musician was working on her album set to be released this year. “In Studio w/ IDandokazi Babes Wodumo Recording Her 2023 Album,” he wrote. At her husband, Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo's memorial service DJ Tira encouraged Babes to get back to her singing career. The Afrotainment owner said Babes needed to be back at the top. “Babes must go back to the top of the charts. When she joined the music industry she was charging R100,000 per gig. You [Babes] should not be comfortable and you need to get out of your comfort zone if you want to go back to the top. You need to work hard and have a focus. Also, we still have Sponge  to raise because Mampintsha is no longer with us. We as his friends, we will do anything for him,” said Tira. Babes was always tied to her husband's hip and they made music together all the time. She explained to TshisaLIVE why she thought Mampintsha was the “perfect” person for her to collaborate with. “Mampintsha is the only one who understands me and the type of gqom I make. Mampintsha understands me and that's why we make great music together, we are able to communicate properly. “Also a lot of artists don't really understand gqom, so I don't want a situation where I feature people that will make my songs lame or drain my vibe. However, I do most of the singing on the songs and I also feature on songs from his album,” Babes said. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
