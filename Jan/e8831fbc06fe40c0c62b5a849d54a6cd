Gqom musician and Mampintsha's widow Babes Wodumo has joined many paying tribute to her mother-in-law Zamanguni Gumede. Mampintsha's mom passed away last night after a short hospital stay at Wentworth Hospital in Durban. Her daughter Pinki Gumede confirmed the news to TshisaLIVE. Babes posted the messages on Mampintsha’s Facebook account, on which she has been posting updates  after the passing of her husband. "RIP, Gogo Ka sponge. Ungikhonzele kumnyeni Wami. Lala kahle, MaGumede," she wrote. Pinki said Gumede called her just before passing to ask her and her children to come say goodbye. “She called us at 10pm to come visit her at the hospital, me and my children. When we arrived she said she wanted to say her last goodbyes. She left us at 11pm. “She held our hands and gave us all a message. She said she was saying goodbye. Her last words to me were that I should look after the children and she will miss Mampintsha's son”. Mampintsha's widow Bongekile “Babes Wodumo” Maphumulo had been at loggerheads with her mother-in-law for several years. Their feud made headlines and was in full view on the Showmax reality TV show Uthando Lodumo. Speaking at Mampintsha's funeral, Babes extended an olive branch to Gumede. “Namuhla ngiyahlambuluka, MaGumede. I would like to forgive you for all your sins (mistakes) because I'm a child of a pastor. I'm saved. “I forgive you. I ask that whatever dispute we have ends, starting today." Babes stood at the pulpit and recounted her husband's last days while being treated at the hospital before his death. “In his last days he said he loved me. I think that's why I'm this strong.
