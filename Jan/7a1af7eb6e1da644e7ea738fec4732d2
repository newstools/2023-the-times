DJ Zinhle has shed light on how to navigate co-parenting, urging her followers to act in the best interest of their  children. In an  Instagram Live, the Umlilo hitmaker  shared  advice on successful co-parenting. “You  have to get over yourself. Get over the guy. If you hate him, get over it. You  have to do this thing for the  children. Remove yourself and your  things from the situation. Some people are  difficult to co-parent with but you  need to be a few steps ahead,” she said. In the live chat, rapper Nomuzi Mabena revealed that Zinhle had no issues having her  daughter Kairo in the same space as AKA's girlfriend Nadia Nakai. “This  family is very modern. Zinhle  saw Nadia on Christmas Day. She went to  pick up Kairo at the house. It's a  functioning modern family. Everybody loves each other,” she said.
