“No-one is going to intimidate us. South Africa will come to a standstill.” Listen to Malema: EFF leader Julius Malema is resolute that President Cyril Ramaphosa must resign as the red berets gear up for the “mother of all shutdowns”. Malema said South Africa will come to a standstill on March 20. The EFF has threatened to close major roads, schools and businesses. “We are not threatened by  security and if they want to violate our rights they will find us ready.” Rising cost of living, load-shedding, unemployment, crime and corruption are among the  reasons for the “shutdown”.
