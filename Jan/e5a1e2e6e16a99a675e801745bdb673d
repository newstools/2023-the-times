Though it is not a privilege all mothers have, Lady Du has managed to have her work schedule revolve around her daughter Mia's life to ensure she gives her as much time as possible. The singer, who juggles business and her gigs as a recording artist, took to Twitter recently to share how happy she is about having managed to create a daily routine that puts her daughter's needs first. The singer said her current happy state of mind was helped by her decision to only take gigs on weekends or on days that don't clash with her daughter's school runs and all her extra-curricula activities. “I take my daughter to school every day and fetch her after school. I stated that I don’t take gigs during the week if they affect her daily routine. This has made my life so easy. I’m never late for any meeting. My day starts at 5am. My body is so used to it. I love it.” Lady Du's love for Mia runs deep and she always shares their conversations and their mother-daughter moments. The musician treats her daughter like her bestie and Mzansi saw the extent of their friendship when Lady Du posted a video exposing how she and her daughter seem to have conflicting ideas about having another baby in the house. The Dakiwe hit maker asked Mia what she thought about having a sibling. The lil girl got triggered by the question, and without letting her mom finish asking, the young girl candidly said she doesn’t want a sibling. Mia didn't explain why but made sure her mama knew she wasn't signing up for the big sister life. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
