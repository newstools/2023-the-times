No fewer  than six hikers  were rescued by helicopter in three separate incidents  at Table Mountain National Park in Cape Town on Monday, Air Mercy Service (AMS) said  on Tuesday. One hiker was retrieved after collapsing in Platteklip Gorge close to the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway, and another from Karbonkelberg close to Hout Bay after suffering from dehydration. The third incident involved four hikers who  were stranded on a ledge after attempting the Diagonal Route   above Camps Bay. The AMS helicopter was also deployed  on Seaforth Beach to rescue a two-year-old child suffering from a medical condition, who was airlifted to Red Cross Children's Hospital. AMS spokesperson Vanessa  Horn said Monday’s frantic workload was partly the result of scorching summer weather. “It really was a very busy day for us, but not very different compared with other festive seasons,” Horn told TimesLIVE in response to queries. “We would be busy with one call and another would come in — usually there’s a bit of a break in between.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
