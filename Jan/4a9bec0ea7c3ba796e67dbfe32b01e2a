Andre Gerhard Ackerman, 52, has pleaded not guilty to 700 charges related to a  paedophile ring. Ackerman, who allegedly ran a sex-trafficking  group, appeared  in the Johannesburg high court on Monday. He was arrested  with advocate Paul Kennedy, who has since committed suicide. In August 2021, TimesLIVE  reported that an indictment before the high court revealed  details of how the advocate and his co-accused allegedly used social media to lure minor boys into human trafficking, sexual exploitation, grooming, assault and rape. The charges related to incidents that allegedly occurred between September 2020 and July 2021. Ackerman's trial started on Monday and will continue on Tuesday. The court heard  he “unlawfully and intentionally had in his possession a cellphone which contained 253 videos of child pornography”. These included videos and pictures  advocating, advertising, encouraging and promoting child pornography  in sexual acts,  conduct or  exploitation.
