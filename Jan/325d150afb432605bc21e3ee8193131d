Music producer and DJ Prince Kaybee has put the spotlight on the ruling party’s promises, questioning if they will ever be achieved. Taking to his Twitter timeline recently, Kaybee asked if free education will be realised “At this rate are we even gonna achieve the free education the ANC promised?” His post evoked mixed reactions from his followers, including discussions on the feasibility of free education and what that looks like. “People like you who are hypocrites, acting like you care here on Twitter but at the polls you continue to put this country in misery. 2024 is the year to prove that you want change, not here on Twitter,” said one user. “LOL, at this rate are we gonna achieve anything promised by the ANC? 2024 we need to vote ANC out. Finish and klaar,” said another. Almost six years ago the presidency released the long-awaited Heher commission report into the possibility of free tertiary education. Former President Jacob Zuma established the commission in January 2016‚ chaired by justice Jonathan Arthur Heher, after the #FeesMustFall protests ripped through the country and institutions of higher learning. The commission recommended that government increase its expenditure on higher education and training to at least 1% of the GDP, in line with comparable economies. The commission further recommended that government pay particular attention to the technical and vocational education and training colleges as they cannot perform at their current funding levels. Speaking at a Freedom Charter rally in Kliptown Soweto last year EFF leader Julius Malema heavily criticised the ANC, claiming the ruling party did not prioritise education and “loves the illiterates”. On the EFF’s plans, he said: “We want free education, so we can get a job and work for ourselves and pay for ourselves. We want our own homes. Not RDP homes.”
