In his mentions, his celeb friends were touched by Somizi's act of kindness. “The happiness I am feeling for her ... But ke I think she can end the suspensions and just say the name once," wrote Khaya Dladla. “This is exactly who you are chu ... since the beginning and until the end ... You", wrote Lorcia Cooper. His followers thanked the star for making his fans' day. “How did you even think of this visit? You made her day, may God bless you more," wrote one. “This is what I wish people knew about you, your heart is your greatest asset. This is definitely you," wrote make-up artist Nomsa Madida.
