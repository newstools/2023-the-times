The Pongola magistrate's court on Wednesday denied bail to the truck driver who was arrested in connection with the deaths of 20 people on the N2 in Pongola in September last year. Sibusiso Siyaya is facing 20 counts of culpable homicide after the truck ploughed into a bakkie transporting schoolchildren. After  his arrest last year, Siyaya abandoned his application for bail. He later applied for bail and the decision denying his release was made on Wednesday. The court found that the state had proven its case that Siyaya was a flight risk who might abscond if released on bail.  The court found that it was not in the interests of justice to grant him bail, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said. The  matter was postponed  to February 17 for further investigation. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
