Radio jock Mark Pilgrim is breathing a sigh of relief after he was discharged from hospital after 64 days. Taking to his socials, he shared with his followers that he had finally received the green light to  head home and breathe  fresh air. He posted a snap of himself being wheeled out by his partner Adrienne. "After 64 days, 7 procedures and losing almost 15kg, today I go home. Still have a tube coming out my side and will have a home nurse looking after me as I slowly build my strength. But nothing beats the healing power of being home with loved ones, doggies, the fresh air and garden," wrote Mark. Mark kept fans regularly updated about his health following a cancer diagnosis last year. The Hot102.7fm radio DJ was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. After a month in ICU, Mark was moved to a general ward late in November. He described it as a step closer to going home. "After 30 days in an ICU bed, I’m skinnier than a toothpick, but  I’m out of ICU. Enjoying the calm environment of general ward, having my own quiet space and my own loo. One step closer to being home." Mark said he was also overjoyed to see and be with his children. "Two of many great things about no longer being in ICU: no more green gown and my girls get to visit."
