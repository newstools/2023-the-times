The city of Ekurhuleni has advised motorists to steer clear of the intersection of Dekema and Osborn roads in Wadeville, Germiston, after a diesel tanker overturned on Friday, spilling some of the 30,000 litres of fuel it was transporting. Spokesperson for Ekurhuleni disaster and emergency management services William Ntladi said emergency services were at the scene and both roads have been closed  to motorists as a precautionary measure. “The situation remains dangerous. We managed to contain the leaking. The diesel tanker was carrying 30,000 litres at the time of the crash. It is a 40,000 litre capacity trailer. The tanker was destined to Alberton from Springs. There are no casualties. The driver was alone at the time of the crash.” Ntladi said details on how  the crash occurred are being investigated. He confirmed  community members  rushed to the scene to fill  buckets with fuel, but have  been dispersed. “We have stopped everyone at the scene who  was trying to get diesel. The situation is under control.” He  urged motorists heading into the Wadeville industrial area to  take alternative routes. “The intersection is going to be closed for some time to allow rehabilitation and recovery of the tanker.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
