YouTuber and influencer Mihlali Ndamase has had people flood her Instagram with congratulatory messages and speculations of having a bun in the oven. She shared snaps on her Instagram on Saturday and her followers were quick to jump to suspecting she was pregnant because of her flowy dress. In her comment section it was a battle between who spotted the alleged bump first. "I thought I was the only one who sees that," wrote one user. "Congratulations on your pregnancy, wow this is amazing," wrote another. In a recent episode titled What Would We Do? posted on her YouTube channel, Mihlali said she was not ready to be a mom. "Honestly, I'm at an age were I could have a baby, I wouldn't mind having a baby. But I'm not ready to be a mom right now, at this very moment. Two years ago I actually wanted a baby so bad. Lockdown I wanted a baby so bad," she said. The YouTuber said she wanted to be a hands-on mom. "There are so many things that I wanna do and I feel like I wanna be a mom when I can fully be devoted to being a mom. I wanna be such a hands-on mom. I would probably have the child and pray that he guides me throughout." If the speculation is correct, Mihlali wouldn't be the first celebrity to have hidden or not formally announced  she was pregnant. Kelly Khumalo got tongues wagging recently when she shared pictures of her performing at a show and fans noticed her seemingly visible baby bump, which fuelled the speculation. After seeing the snaps, fans deduced that Kelly had a bun in the oven and started flooding her comments section with well wishes. The singer later took to her Instagram to flaunt her baby bump while in KwaZulu-Natal. According to Zimoja, Kelly is expecting a baby with former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder and boyfriend of three years Mthokozisi Vincent Yende.
