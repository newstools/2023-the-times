Rapper Nasty C might  be over the moon  after American RnB singer Chris Brown co-signed him. The US star posted a clip of Nasty's rap freestyle on his Insta stories and Nasty C reposted it on his timeline. “Bro whaaat? (and this freestyle’s almost ag 500K on OTR YouTube channel),” he wrote. Chris joins Canadian-born rapper Drake whose co-signing of Mzansi musicians has become  second nature to the rapper. He reposted a clip from Uncle Waffles’ stories on  Instagram  last year which was considered a co-sign in the music world. “Co-sign” is a form of endorsement on social media, especially when bigger and more established artist show love to an upcoming star — an informal way of giving a shoutout or stamp of approval. Her debut album Red Dragon  became the most streamed project on Apple Music in the country. “This moment  feels  surreal  and I’m  so grateful for what my life has become in the past six months,” Waffles  wrote on Twitter. Drake also lauded  South African amapiano hitmaker Kelvin Momo for his music skills. “You, my friend ... are from another planet. Listening to you is like a religious experience,” the message read. Reacting to the message, Kelvin said the rapper's shoutout meant the world to him. “Waking up to such. Speechless! le re nna ke etsa hanyani, jokes aside. Getting a DM from Drake means a lot, I don’t even know what to say but [I] am f*cken grateful man,” he wrote. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
