It  is  gratifying to see young specialist doctors choosing Limpopo to  serve the people,  health MEC  Phophi Ramathuba said on Wednesday. She  welcomed  newly appointed orthopaedic surgeon Dr Sipho Motloung  to Lebowakgomo Hospital. Motloung qualified  at the University of the Free State in July last year. “Dr Motloung used to be our guest specialist during the rural health matters outreach campaign in the beginning of 2022 and he was motivated to relocate to Limpopo to establish an orthopaedics unit in a district hospital,” Ramathuba said. The outreach campaign comprises a  team of medical and dental specialists who render services to rural hospitals with the aim of clearing surgical and medical backlogs. Ramathuba said after receiving  many complaints from patients at Lebowakgomo Hospital when they were turned away  from  tertiary hospitals because of long queues and lack of beds, the department had to intervene and recruit Motloung to be stationed at the hospital. “We look forward to working with Dr Motloung in advancing the healthcare system.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
