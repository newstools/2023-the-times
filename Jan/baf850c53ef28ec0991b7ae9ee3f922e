The City of Cape Town is investigating the cause of a fire that destroyed a  MyCiTi bus on Monday. The  urban mobility directorate reported the MyCiTi express bus was on the N2 inbound, close to the Bhunga Avenue turn-off near Langa, when the fire broke out  shortly before 8am. The bus, with 60 passengers on board, was on its way from Mitchells Plain to the Civic Centre station in the city centre when passengers alerted the driver about smoke at the back  of the vehicle. The  driver pulled over and  passengers were evacuated. “The city’s fire services  extinguished the fire and we  confirm the bus driver and  about 60 passengers disembarked unharmed,” the city said. A replacement bus transported the passengers to the Civic Centre station. “We will investigate the cause of the fire with assistance from the vehicle operating company, independent assessors, insurers and the vehicle manufacturer,”   MMC for urban mobility Rob Quintas said. Details would only be available once the assessments had been completed, he said. “I’m  grateful  nobody was injured. I  thank the passengers and  driver for staying calm and responsive and express my appreciation to the police and  firefighters for their prompt assistance.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
