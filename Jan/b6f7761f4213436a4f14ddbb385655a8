Trevor Noah and his friends always serve friendship goals, and there are no better people  he wants by his side. They all took to their socials to share their activities that ranged from jet skiing and off-roading to poolside chilling and white water river rafting. The comedian made an analogy out of their  river rafting to their friendship that spans more than 10 years. "This year's annual friend vacation had brought us to Costa Rica and for the first time we’d be white water river rafting. The guide told us it had just rained so the rapids would be class 3 to 4, which really excited us because we didn’t know what that actually meant." Although most  shared their experiences, Trevor managed to write a lengthy post sharing step by step. "The first 20 minutes were easy - so easy we started chatting about which countries we’d want to river raft in next. Then the actual rapids began, and most of our conversation turned to sounds  only Africans would understand. "Each drop was steeper and scarier than the previous one and just when we thought we’d seen it all, our guide told us the next drop coming up was a rapid the locals nicknamed 'Terminator'. It started like every other rapid, as you can tell from my smile, but soon the boat was almost vertical and then we were all smashed in the face by Mike Tyson in water form." Read the full post here. Every year, he and Khaya Dlanga, Kaya 959 DJ Sizwe Dhlomo, 947 breakfast host Anele Mdoda and brand and communications mogul Xolisa Dyeshana go on holiday. In 2021, Trevor and his friends took over Cape Town, with his ex-girlfriend Kelly Minka spotted with the squad. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
