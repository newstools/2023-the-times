Ndlovu Youth Choir  made Mzansi proud after delivering a stellar performance at America's Got Talent. After making the final in 2019, the singing group was selected as part of the top 16 acts of all time among  Got Talent franchises to compete in the All Star show. The show that aired on Monday showcased the choir,  known  for performing trendy songs, singing an original song, We Will Rise. “We dedicated our performance to the people of South Africa. We wanted to do an original song instead of a cover, we have amazing song writers. It's about the South African spirit of resilience,”  artistic director Ralf Schmitt told TshisaLIVE. “There are so many young South Africans who  just need an opportunity and we tried to represent well. Being on that stage is a huge privilege and honour, and a reminder to the country about the potential of South Africans.” While they might not have won the competition, Ralf  says he is proud of how far they have come in the music industry and they feel ready to  take over  international stages around the world. “It's always an honour being on such a big stage. It may have been a bit daunting but we have such an incredible mentorship in the choir and take good care of them that they took the challenge by the horns. When they didn't go through, I told them that they had won a career in the arts and I am proud that they get to reap all kinds of opportunities coming our way.” Watch the video below:
