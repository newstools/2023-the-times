Prince Kaybee has slammed claims  he did not create his hit song Fetch Your Life. This after Nota Baloyi took to his timeline  arguing  the DJ and producer  used a song by Calvin Harris to produce Fetch Your Life featuring Msaki. “I've got bigger songs than Fetch Your Life. Fetch Your Life beat was taken from Calvin Harris. Prince Kaybee took a Calvin Harris song, replayed it, simple, [and it was] a hit. Anything you write on that Calvin Harris beat is a hit ... Fetch Your Life is a Calvin Harris song,” he said. Prince Kaybee said while Nota might feel the need to take away from artists  such as Msaki, he did not want the credit  for his work  given to someone else. “LOL, Nota my friend, you can attack Msaki all you want, but this claim that Fetch Your Life is a Calvin Harris beat is unjustifiable. You are reaching! Someone please attach the Calvin Harris song and its composition merits that commensurate Fetch Your Life. Thanks,” he wrote. “I don’t know the mathematics of what's happening between Nota and Msaki so I won’t interfere. Please allow me to not be a hindrance in other people's business. It might be just a beat to you but to me it's my legacy and hard work originally composed, so will fight for that.” Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
