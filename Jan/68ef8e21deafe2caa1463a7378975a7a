An alleged escape plan  by two inmates at Kgosi Mampuru  prison in Pretoria was foiled by  prison officials on Tuesday. Emmanuel Muchandizwa, serving 17 years for robbery and being  an illegal immigrant,  and Thembani Mudau, serving 14 years for robbery and housebreaking, “managed to cut open  window grills using hacksaw blades”, correctional services department (DCS) spokesperson  Singabakho Nxumalo said. “The department  has applauded its officials for a job well done after foiling an escape operation by two inmates,” Nxumalo told TimesLIVE. “DCS officials were testing and inspecting the grills when they discovered  the structure has been tampered with. A search was conducted during which six hacksaw blades were located.” Upon  questioning, the two  inmates said the blades were smuggled into prison in a visitor’s  shoes. “Both offenders are Zimbabweans  and were  sentenced last year  in June and July respectively,” Nxumalo said. Correctional services national commissioner Makgothi Thobakgale is scheduled to visit  the prison on Wednesday to inspect the damage  done by the two prisoners.
