Eskom has ramped up load-shedding to stage 3 from 4pm on Wednesday until further notice. This was because of the breakdown of two generating units and the delay in returning to service of three generating units from planned maintenance. Eskom had been implementing stage 2 load-shedding since December 31 after earlier  promising there would  be no load-shedding on New Year's Day.
