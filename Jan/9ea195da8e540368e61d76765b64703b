The election of a new speaker for the Ditsobotla municipality in the North West  started with a secret ballot on Monday. Councillors of the Lichtenburg  municipality were sworn in earlier  after by-elections in December,  when the ANC  received less than 50% of the vote for the first time. The council was dissolved in September amid ANC faction battles in the town. Ditsobotla is infamous for having had two mayors, two speakers and two municipal managers from warring ANC factions for most of 2022. Monday's meeting is in Mahikeng, about 40km from Lichtenburg. No party has a majority in the council and the first  meeting on December 28 was  cancelled after disruptions  by newly elected councillors. Last week contract workers  caused mayhem as they  stormed the municipal building in Lichtenburg and took documents which they threw in the streets. DA  Ditsobotla caucus leader Yusuf Laher confirmed to TimesLIVE  they had been sworn in. “We’ve just been sworn in and the proceedings for the election of a speaker, executive committee and mayor will proceed,” Laher said.
