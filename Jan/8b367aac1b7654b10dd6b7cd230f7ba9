Three people  have been arrested for allegedly selling proof of residence documents  outside the Mkhondeni testing centre in Pietermaritzburg. They  were arrested on Wednesday  after an undercover investigation by the Msunduzi municipality. Council speaker Eunice Majola said they received a tip-off about the trio operating at the centre and verified the information. “There are a number of proof of residence [documents] that have been found  and some have been sold. We  set up a  trap with our security personnel by sending them to  buy the letter. Corruption is taking place here.” Majola said  proof of residence documents  for the eThekwini municipality were also found. She said the three  were  handed to  police for questioning. They would investigate  to  determine if anyone else was involved. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
