A man drowned and another is missing  in the Western Cape, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI)  said on Tuesday. On Monday, rescuers recovered the body of a man who was one of two occupants of a small boat  after it capsized  at Maasbaai near  Cape Hangklip. The second man managed to swim to safety. In a separate incident, NSRI  Strandfontein crew were alerted to a missing swimmer who reportedly disappeared at Garbage Beach near  Mnandi in False Bay. “Despite an extensive search, no sign of the man  was found and police are investigating,” the NSRI said. Earlier this week, the NSRI cautioned members of the public to beware of spring tide conditions leading up to the full moon  this weekend.
