Fuel prices across the board are set to increase in February, says the Automobile Association (AA). Commenting on unaudited data from the Central Energy Fund, the AA says petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin will be more expensive next month, again adding financial strain on already cash-strapped South Africans. The latest data  shows an increase of  about 52c/l cents for 95 ULP petrol and  about 57c/l for 93 ULP petrol, and increases of between 22c/l and 33c/l for diesel. The price of illuminating paraffin will climb by  about 38c/l. “The data is showing  price increases to international petroleum products are the main driver behind this expected increase to local fuel prices, while the strength of the rand against the  dollar is limiting these increases by between 10c  and 14c  on all fuels,”  the AA said. “Increases  in fuel prices now,  when South Africans are grappling with, among other  things, financial pressures and rolling blackouts, is unwelcome. We again  urge the government to revisit the fuel pricing structure  to find ways to mitigate against this and other possible increases in future.” Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
