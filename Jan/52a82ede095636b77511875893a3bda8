The social media streets were in a mess this week after a “fall out” between media mogul Bonang Matheba and her cousin Pinky Girl. The pair have been posting cryptic messages about travelling abroad that have fans convinced are aimed at each other. The fireworks kicked off when Bonang revealed she was looking to hire a new personal assistant who was fully vaccinated after being let down. “I need to find a new PA with a visa to join the team. Wtf is happening? Missing out on trips around the world because you’re unvaccinated. Ridiculous,” she tweeted. Pinky Girl posted what many thought was a reply to Bonang, saying: “That’s just being shallow. From being dragged, unfollowed and blocked for no reason while I’m pushing the love.” She also claimed she was vaccinated. “Moghel is vaccinated. And she has her vaccination certificate. And not going anywhere.” The “feud” started a debate around whether to take family arguments to social media, with some claiming some disagreements should be sorted in-house. Others said people should be allowed to vent their frustrations on whatever platform they see fit. The Daily Star Bangladesh shared hilarious insight into four types of family members on social media. They include those who appear friendly and  never take sides but are secretly stalking and getting the gossip. There are those who police family members' timelines and always give an opinion, those who post cryptic messages or quotes that are a clear dig at someone, and those who  block everyone and pretend they don't have social media. CBC Canada  shared tips on how to keep the peace with family online, including being sensitive to what you post and rather opening up offline.
