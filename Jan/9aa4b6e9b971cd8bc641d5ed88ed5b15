Tuesday marks  the first day in office for  new South African National Roads Agency  (Sanral) CEO Reginald Lavhelesani Demana. In October, cabinet approved,  on the recommendation of the Sanral board,  transport minister Fikile Mbalula's appointment of Demana. The roads agency  has not had a permanent CEO since  Skhumbuzo Macozoma's term expired in November 2021. “Not only are we ushering in a new year, but also a time for new and fresh leadership in the position of  CEO, taking Sanral into 2023 and beyond,” Sanral board chairperson Themba Mhambi said. Demana was formerly a divisional executive at the Industrial Development Corporation, a state-owned development finance institution, where he was responsible for a portfolio that covered mining, metals, infrastructure and energy. He is an  engineer with more than 20 years’ working experience, with a focus on mergers and acquisitions, structuring of BEE deals, capital raising and general strategic corporate finance. “Sanral remains front and centre in leading South Africa’s economic recovery plan post Covid-19 with public infrastructure development prioritised by  government,” Mhambi said. “To this end, our stakeholders will look to  Demana to continue on this trajectory and make every effort to see more projects put out to tender this year.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
