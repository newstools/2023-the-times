Reddam House College in Ballito delivered its first cohort of matriculants who achieved a 100% bachelor's degree pass rate. The school was third-highest in the Inspired Education Group with top pupil Gia Naicker achieving eight distinctions. The 2022 top achievers from Bedfordview’s Saheti School are gearing up for bright futures in medicine and other disciplines. Hannah Hill is Saheti’s top candidate. She achieved the highest average of 95% and full house distinctions in 11 subjects. In 10 subjects she achieved  90% and higher.

According to the school, the top pupils in both streams averaged in the 80% mark, with a full house of distinctions in the subjects written.

Top Hilton College matriculant Tanner Bailey, who bagged eight distinctions in the Independent Examination Board (IEB) exams, has his sights set on studying business at a US Ivy League university.
