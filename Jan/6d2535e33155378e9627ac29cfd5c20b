Amad said his administration would seek to address the city’s finances, water security issues, the electricity crisis and service delivery. LISTEN: “It is no secret  we are unfortunately inheriting a city  under massive financial strain. Therefore  the stabilisation of the city’s finances and financial sustainability are to be prioritised,” said Amad. He was elected last week after the axing of the DA’s Mpho Phalatse on Thursday when a motion of no confidence was passed against her.
