Tshwane emergency medical services (EMS)  are on high alert  after a cloudburst in Pretoria  flooded two roads  and vehicles were trapped. EMS spokesperson Charles Mabaso said vehicles were stuck in  water under two bridges  in the city centre, but the occupants managed to get to safety. One incident was on Steve Biko Road crossing Johan Heyns Drive. “The road beneath the bridge was flooded and one vehicle got  stuck. However, the occupants moved  to safety without  major issues. “In Pretoria North, leaving Paul Kruger and Rachel De Beer streets, another vehicle got  stuck under a bridge. The occupants of that vehicle also managed to get to safety,” Mabaso said. Metro police had been deployed to both areas to ensure motorists’ safety. “We are on standby and remain on high alert as we monitor other incidents. We have been out to monitor other areas which are hotspots for flooding as well,” he said. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
