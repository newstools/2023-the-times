Newzroom Africa's decision to rope in Somizi Mhlongo for analysis of the alleged Maselspoort Resort racist attack has sparked debate and outrage. The Idols  South Africa judge and media personality was among the celebrities who took to their timeline expressing  anger at a viral video showing a group of white men allegedly attempting to prevent black teens from swimming in a pool at a resort outside Bloemfontein in the Free State on Christmas Day. The video showed  men demanding a black teenager get out of the water, then hitting or shoving him back in, grabbing a child by the throat and pulling his hair. One man was seen holding a boy under the water. Newzroom Africa had social media in uproar after they shared a post  — which has since been deleted — advertising that Somizi would share his views on the incident. While some  said Somizi was free to share his views on the matter, others  said it was an attention-seeking exercise. “Somizi le yena shouldn't say yes to everything. He should have known  this is above him. This is a huge matter not to be taken lightly,” wrote one Twitter user. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
