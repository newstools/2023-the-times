Cassper Nyovest shot up timelines again on Thursday after a video of Canadian-American rapper Drake playing  his hit song. A video of Drake listening  to Siyathandana by Cassper  featuring Boohle has been circulating on the timeline. Cassper took to his timeline reacting to the video with the caption: “Drake playing Siyathandana in New York last night. Asbonge!!!” Watch the video below: Siyathandana has been one of Cassper's  biggest hits. Cassper rose to fame with the release of his debut studio album Tsholofelo and has been breaking boundaries and making history  since. While he's produced many hit songs, he's expanded his brand and explored business  ventures. In 2021, Cassper launched a liquor brand, Billiato, and a sneaker line with Drip Footwear called The Root of Fame. The rapper ventured into the television industry, presenting the second season of The Braai Show on SABC1. Cassper recently took to his timeline saying he did not feel the need to prove himself any more. “Nah, I’ve done my thing. If there’s guys who still don’t rate me, it’s on them. No more points to prove, raps, music, hits, money, business, whatever man. I’m that dude FR overall. Those who don’t see it yet will never ever see it and that’s OK. Next chapter,” he wrote.
