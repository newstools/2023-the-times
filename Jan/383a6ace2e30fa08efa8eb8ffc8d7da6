A multidisciplinary team will be established to deal with the political killings in Mpumalanga, police minister Bheki Cele said on Monday. Cele was speaking at the home of  ANC councillor Sbonelo Mthembu who was  shot dead with two other men on Friday at his home in Mkhondo,  Mpumalanga. Police  would deal with the killings in Mpumalanga  in the same way they did in KwaZulu-Natal. “We have met the management of the police  here. And we have identified  gaps. Maybe the approaches we have used where there are political killings, like KZN, is the same approach we need to use. We need a multidisciplinary approach. It will not take  long to resolve the cases,” Cele said. During the visit they established  there were tensions in communities,  apparently because the alleged perpetrators have not been arrested. “Some of them are  known. They have names. But ours, as the police, is not to come here and repeat the names. Ours is to come and put the faces to the people of those names.” Police  would not be rushed into  action that  would not yield  results. “We are not going to do things the way that we are going to regret. Arrests should not be for withdrawal or acquittal. The investigating team should do thorough work which will give positive results,” Cele said.
