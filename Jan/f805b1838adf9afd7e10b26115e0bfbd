ANC  MPs who disregard party orders will face the music and be disciplined, says newly elected  secretary-general Fikile Mbalula. Listen: The ANC ordered  MPs to vote against adopting the section 89 Phala Phala report in parliament which found President Cyril Ramaphosa  may have a prima facie case to answer. Those who defied the order  were Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Mervyn Dirks, Mosebenzi Zwane and Supra Mahumapelo. Mbalula said their conduct is on the agenda for the party's January 8 111th anniversary celebrations. Ramaphosa is expected to  reshuffle his cabinet after the  January 8 statement. On the  cabinet reshuffle, Mbalula said  they do not want people “who sleep on the job” and should the president bring in “sleepers”, the party will not agree to  it. Before the January 8 statement, the ANC will resume its  national conference in a hybrid manner for two days after it was adjourned in December.
