South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya and her wife Violet recently marked a milestone in their marriage. Six years ago the couple vowed to spend the rest of their lives together after seven years of dating. Celebrating their wedding anniversary recently, the couple posted precious moments they shared together over the years. "Six years in the making, I wish us more to come. Aaaah ngwana as mpha ke ya tjeya shitah," Caster wrote. Violet took to her timeline to speak about how Caster's love gave her strength to take on anything life threw their way. "Being in a relationship with you for 13 years gives me a peaceful existence. You make my life right and complete. Your life is the strength that drives me to do everything for this family. You are the armour that shields me from tears. Happy six year anniversary to us, Caster. I love you so much." In another post, Violet celebrated Caster's 32nd birthday. "There is no need for a special day to remind me how special you are and how important in my life. The stars shine wherever you go." Caster and her bae have two children together. Violet  revealed they had undergone four unsuccessful insemination processes before conceiving their first daughter. “God answers in three ways. He said yes and gives you what you want. He says no and gives you something better. He says wait and gives you the best. He gave us the best, which is you my lovely, clever princess. We had four unsuccessful insemination processes before we conceived you. Happy third birthday to you, my cute little princess. “You brought so much happiness to everyone around you and we love you so much, Oratile the Miracle,” she wrote.
