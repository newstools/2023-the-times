Thandiswa Mazwai said South Africans have lost touch with their humanity. She shared a video posted on Twitter of Somalian nationals being turned away from  Barcelona Clinic in Daveyton. Taking to her Twitter timeline, she labelled the act  "insane". "This is insane.! Nibiza abantu ngezinja. Hawu!Lafa elihle. Baphela nya UbuNtu. I know you think we have a right to this behaviour but I’m telling you once UbuNtu buphele emntwini we are all fu**ed as abaNtu. And you have seen it. South Africans have lost Ubuntu babo! Nembeza dololo," In her mentions her followers shared different sentiments. "You celebs are really out of touch with the daily struggles of the low income citizens. Such a shame that a person who once claimed to be one of them is now talking about ubuntu in their gated communities with medical aid and their kids attending private schools," tweeted one. "These terms Ubuntu, xenophobia, Afrophobia, etc are just terms used by the privileged part of South Africa to blackmail us into silence when we raise genuine concerns. Being rich doesn't automatically gives you misplaced 'high morality' over the poor. Ngeke Sizwe ngani nina," tweeted another. Operation Dudula last year called for government to declare a state of emergency over illegal immigration. This came after home affairs minister Aaron Motsoaledi extended the validity of the Zimbabwean exemption permit for another six months to June 30 2023. Speaking on Power 98.7, Operation Dudula spokesperson Zandile Dabula said the government was turning a blind eye to the issue of illegal immigrants. “Our government is rejecting us. That is why you once heard our president calling us vigilantes. That means he does not take us seriously. The issues we are raising are affecting our community members daily on the ground,” said Dabula.
