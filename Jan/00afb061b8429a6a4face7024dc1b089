Sheba, the missing female tiger that escaped from  her enclosure  at Walker’s Fruit Farm, south of Johannesburg, was spotted via drone thermal imaging at a waterhole in the area on Monday evening. Tracking teams on foot later saw paw prints around the waterhole and her scent was also picked up. “She was very close but the bush was too thick and risky for them to enter,” Walker’s Fruit Farm community policing forum member Gresham Mandy said. The team was going to put out  meat laced with a tranquiliser to entice the tiger to eat.  It was hoped this  would make her drowsy and  easy for the team to  capture  her. “We will be baiting tonight and hopefully the morning will yield some  positive results,” Mandy said. Since  she escaped, the tiger has mauled two dogs, a pig, a deer and a man who is  being treated in hospital. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
