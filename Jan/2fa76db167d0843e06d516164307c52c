Masechaba Khumalo is seemingly off the market. On Sunday Masechaba took to Instagram  to share a picture of her wearing a wedding veil with the caption “God's time”, alluding  she  married again recently. The post received many congratulatory messages from her industry peers, including Lerato Mvelase, Nomcebo Zikode and Gigi Lamayne. Masechaba's post comes after she unveiled her pregnancy. In December, the 39-year-old media personality and spokesperson for the department of sports, arts and culture took to her Instagram timeline to share a post of her growing baby bump with the caption “Grateful”. Masechaba did not reveal details about how far along she is nor the identity of her mystery baby daddy. Attempts by TshisaLIVE to get comment from Masechaba were unsuccessful at the time of publishing this article. An update will be included once received. Kefilwe Mabote also recently revealed she tied the knot on January 3. The social media influencer shared snaps from her nuptials, where she donned a gorgeous dress by celebrity designer Gert-Johan Coetzee and a big diamond ring. In the post where she poses with her family members, she expressed her gratitude to her family. “For the love of family triumphs all. Thank you for walking this journey with me. This is definitely the beginning of a chapter called 'us'.”
