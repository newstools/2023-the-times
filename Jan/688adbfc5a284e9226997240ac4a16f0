An alleged serial rapist  accused of terrorising the Bolobedu and Tzaneen communities in Limpopo has abandoned his bail application. The 33-year-old appeared briefly in the Bolobedu magistrate’s court outside Tzaneen on Wednesday. In an earlier appearance on Tuesday, a charge of attempted murder was added to his charge sheet. . The National Prosecuting Authority  said  he was arrested in Tzaneen on Wednesday last week in connection with seven rapes. At the time, he was out on R2,000 bail for allegedly raping a 15-year-old girl in 2021. Police spokesperson Col Malesela Ledwaba said police  are investigating at least seven rape cases reported between 2015 and 2016 in which the modus operandi was similar. The man may be linked to more cases as  investigations continue. “Investigations revealed  the [alleged] perpetrator targeted unsuspecting women on their way to Tzaneen town who either did not know the area  well or he  offered  assistance, and in doing so he would lure them to secluded areas. They  were raped and robbed  of their belongings.” Ledwaba said one of the victims was hacked with a panga. The man also allegedly targeted women hitchhiking on the R71  near Tzaneen Spur restaurant on the way to Phalaborwa and Giyani. “Concerted efforts  were made to apprehend the [alleged] perpetrator who was unknown until he was  linked through forensic evidence. “Police appeal to victims who may have fallen prey to this suspect to come forward and report the matter at the nearest police station or call the crime stop number 086 00 10111, or report via MySAPSApp,” he said.
