It’s only the beginning of the year and musician Nkosazana Daughter has already had much to celebrate after she bought a new car. Congratulatory messages flooded the amapiano star’s timeline after she shared images of her new ride with a bow on it. “Kick-starting the year,” she captioned the post. In December 2022, ZiMoja reported the singer and musician Sir Trill had secretly welcomed a new baby. A source alleged the singer parked her December gigs during the festive period because of her child. While the singer has not addressed the reports, she recently shed light on why she chose to maintain a private life. “Ay mina I even forgot I’m a celebrity. Ngiyaziphilela nje (I’m just living for myself).” Another amapiano artist who recently bought a car is Boohle. The mellifluous vocalist purchased a Mercedes-Benz V-Class. The singer expressed her gratitude to God and her fans for helping make it possible. “To God be the glory. To my supporters I love you.” she wrote.
