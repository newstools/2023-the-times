In this episode of Taking The Rams By The Horns on SowetanLIVE, Rams smells a rat as Nqaba Bhanga quits the DA’s Eastern Cape leadership. Bhanga joins Mabote via Zoom to discuss the move. LISTEN HERE: Bhanga mentions the trauma  he suffered from a 2021 accident  he was involved in, in which two people died. “A good dancer must know when to leave the stage ... I've done my part,” he says. Mabote  questions whether he could be throwing in the towel as he's “lost the fight” on race relations in the opposition party. Find out how Bhanga answered. And in an open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa, our intrepid podcaster gives our No 1 citizen a piece of his mind.
