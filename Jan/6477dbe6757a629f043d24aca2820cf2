Police in Hendrina, Mpumalanga, are appealing for help to locate Lushka Taljaard, 27, and her four-year-old son, Daniel Petrus Taljaard. They were last seen on Thursday at 5am when Taljaard's husband left for work. When her husband arrived home at 5pm, he could not find his wife and son. Both his wife’s phones had been switched off. After a fruitless search, he reported the case to the police. “During investigation Lushka’s vehicle, a silver grey VW Polo R-line, was found abandoned at Arnot/ Hendrina Road opposite the entrance to Kwazamokuhle township,” police spokesperson Brig Selvy Mohlala said.
