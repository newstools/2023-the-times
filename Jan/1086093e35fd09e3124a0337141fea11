Kaizer Chiefs have completed the signing of two new foreign players in a bid to boost their ailing squad. The Premier Soccer League (PSL) giants have announced  they have  obtained the services of Congolese 22-year-old left-footed striker Christian Saile Basomboli and Botswana’s Thatayaone Ditlhokwe. While Basomboli is set to join Amakhosi for  this season immediately, left-footed defender Ditlhokwe will only join the Soweto side  before the 2023/2024 campaign as he only signed a pre-contract. Ditlhokwe, 24, is  on the books of SuperSport United where he has been playing since 2020. “The highly rated international who captains Botswana’s national team has  inked a four-year contract and will arrive to begin his life in Naturena in July 2023,” Chiefs wrote on their social media pages. There are hopes that the arrival of Basomboli will boost Chiefs' attacking department, which has been identified as one of their biggest downfalls this season. “Kaizer Chiefs are pleased to announce the signing of Congolese 22-year-old left-footed striker Christian Saile Basomboli,” the club said. “Basomboli arrives in Naturena after penning a three-and-a-half-[year] deal with the Glamour Boys.” Before his move to Chiefs, Basomboli was playing for Zambian outfit Nchanga Rangers.
