Back at work and already planning your next break from the office? You’re likely not alone. As soon as the great migration back to the office begins, many people start looking forward to the spate of public holidays which starts in March. With a bit of clever manoeuvring you can use  South Africa's public holidays to work in your favour. Here are some ideas: Human Rights Day (March 21) Easter Weekend (April 7-10) Freedom Day (April 27) and Worker’s Day (May 1) Youth Day (June 16) Women’s Day (August 9) Heritage Day (September 24) Christmas (December 25 and 26) and New Year’s Day (January 1) Keep in mind: The Day of Reconciliation (December 16) falls on a Saturday and doesn’t prove to be of much use in extending your annual leave. But if you decide to forego five days of annual leave during the year to take over December, you can put in eight days from December 18-22 and December 27-29 and have a total of 17 days off over the festive season.
