K.O had an amazing 2022 and  has been pretty humble about it. Taking to his Instagram timeline recently,  he had a  humble brag while sharing snaps of himself on a yacht enjoying champers. “I be too humble to celebrate my blessings at times. Anyway, 2023 is in full swing. Enjoy being back at work/school and all that. I’m back in the studio. Love and light,” the rapper posted. K.O was a big winner at last year's SA Hip Hop Awards, scooping  song of the year, best video and best collabo awards for his hit song SETE featuring Young Stunna and Blxckie.
