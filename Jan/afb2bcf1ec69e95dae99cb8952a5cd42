Eskom on Monday cancelled its scheduled update briefing  on the  load-shedding crisis, saying  its management team was meeting  President Cyril Ramaphosa. The power utility  earlier announced that outgoing CEO Andre de Ruyter and his  team will host a virtual media briefing at 5pm as South Africa is gripped by load-shedding. “Unfortunately, this afternoon’s media briefing is postponed due to emergency engagements with the president. A new date and time can only be confirmed once meetings with the president are concluded,” Eskom said. Eskom implemented  stage 6 load-shedding  on Wednesday. Ramaphosa announced on Sunday  he had  cancelled his  trip to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, this week to deal with the power crisis.
