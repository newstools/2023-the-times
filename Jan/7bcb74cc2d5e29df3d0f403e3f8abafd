Metro FM presenter and DJ Lamiez Holworthy-Morule is not impressed with pregnancy jokes doing the rounds online lately. She wrote a lengthy Instagram post and shared that though hers seemed like an easy pregnancy where there are no “drastic changes”, it was not reason to be compared with other pregnant women. “On a more serious note? So I’ve seen the comparisons, compliments and even jokes about pregnancy and whilst I count myself very lucky because I haven’t experienced any drastic physical changes (although the abdominal pains, swollen legs, nausea, migraines and hormones are showing me real flames) I simply don’t like the jokes attacking other pregnant women.” “Truth is, no-one has control over how they look or even how smoothly their pregnancy goes and to be subjected to the demeaning words and unnecessary verbal and emotional abuse isn’t fair. ANY woman who carries life is a superhero with superpowers in my opinion and should all be celebrated and embraced regardless of how they look.” Lamiez has opened up before about her pregnancy journey, saying it in not all it was cut out to be. “As funny as it is, there’s a lot of changes that come with being pregnant, physically, mentally and emotionally. Throw in the hormones, the nausea, the abdominal pains and migraines and the only thing that makes it all worth it is feeling your baby kick. Nothing could’ve ever prepared me for this journey but it is one I am so grateful for,” she wrote.
