Thokozani Sphamandla, popularly known as L'vovo Derrango, is recovering well at home after being discharged from  hospital on Friday. The musician was rushed to hospital after suffering a stroke just before Christmas. Speaking to TshisaLIVE, L'vovo recalled how he was wrapping up a performance in Ndwedwe, KwaZulu-Natal, when he  felt dizzy and lost feeling on the left side of his body. “ I was kept in hospital for so long because my blood pressure was too high so they had to stabilise it, but I am feeling much better,” said L'vovo. L'vovo's speech has been affected by the stroke and he has a slight facial droop. He said he had learnt to look after his body. “When we work we tend to eat the wrong food on the streets. What I've learnt from this is to take care of myself and my body, not to overwork and to maintain a healthy diet.” The Bayang'sukela hit maker recently made his social media comeback, posting a picture of himself back at home with loved ones. L'vovo said he was grateful for the love and support he'd received from his family, friends, and fans. The star survived a horrific car accident  months earlier. He said he hopes 2023 will be a better year. “I am busy with my EP right. I'm not here to play. This year I am here to make noise. I am here and I am not going anywhere. I'm OK. I will be dropping a lot of music to celebrate my friend Mampintsha. I was not able to go to his funeral but my heart was there.” Big Nuz star Mampintsha died last month after suffering a stroke.
