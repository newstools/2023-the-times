The eThekwini municipality has condemned violent protests against service interruptions,  saying they are irresponsible and cause delays  in restoring  services. On Sunday main entry points into Phoenix, north of Durban, were blockaded by burning tyres, allegedly by residents frustrated over a lack of electricity and water  in the  township. Several areas north of Durban, including Phoenix, were without  power since Friday despite residents logging faults with the municipality. Municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela told TimesLIVE on Monday the city has been “experiencing multiple faults as a result of load-shedding which has aggravated the situation”. “The challenge of extreme heat and humidity that is synonymous with our city  at this time of the year has compounded our woes. “After  faults were brought to the attention of the city our teams worked around the clock, which resulted  in power being restored in the area at about 8pm [Sunday]. “We  apologise for this inconvenience which is worsened by circumstances  beyond the city’s control.” He appealed to communities “not to resort to violent service delivery protests in the event of the interruption of service delivery”. “This conduct is irresponsible and causes  delays in restoring services which poses a threat to the welfare of our residents.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
