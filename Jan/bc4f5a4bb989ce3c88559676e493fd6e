Actor Sello Maake kaNcube has taken to social media to share his memories of  late veteran actor Patrick Shai, who died on January 22 last year in what police called a suicide. Sello was among the friends who wore white when they joined the Shai family on Sunday to visit the late actor's grave and later had lunch at Patrick's home to share fond memories. On Wednesday Sello took to his timeline sharing images of the occasion with the caption “The 22nd of January marked a year since Patrick Shai’s passing. The family came together with our team to celebrate the great man that Motlogolo was and it was a blessed day. Mixed emotions but we are one unit with the Shai family! Continue to #RIP Patrick Shai.” Patrick Shai's nephew, Lekgetho Shai, told TshisaLIVE  that family gatherings had not been the same since his uncle’s death because he had always been the life of the party. “It was a gathering to honour his memory, the things he's done for the family. It was such a sad day because time flew by very fast. It was just a lot for Masechaba [the wife] and the kids,” he said. “We spoke about how things have changed since his passing. He was a very vibey person, so whenever we had family gatherings he'd be there making sure everyone is happy. He’d be dancing throughout, so yesterday was a little bit low because we could all feel that there was someone who is not here any more, we missed his presence.” Picking up the pieces after his passing has not been easy but Lekgetho  said he was grateful he had been there for the family through their emotional turmoil. “Personally, it has been hard given the fact that I stay with the family [wife and his kids]. Having to see them go through all of the breakdowns every day or maybe twice a week ... It has been one of the hardest things ever to experience them going through the pain. But they are taking it day by day, we all are.”
