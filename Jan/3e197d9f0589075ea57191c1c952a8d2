An alleged house robber was killed and five others  are in hospital under police guard after they crashed into a truck during a high-speed car chase in Durban on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Col Robert Netshiunda said the gang was trying to evade arrest when the accident occurred on Umbilo Road outside the city. “The Umbilo task team were patrolling  Fielden Drive in Umbilo when they spotted a vehicle with six occupants,” he said. “The vehicle was  identified as one which was reported to have been involved in a house robbery in  Malvern  earlier in the day. “With the suspects defying police’s instruction to stop, a high-speed chase ensued. The suspects drove into  oncoming traffic on Umbilo Road and collided head-on with a horse and trailer [truck].” Netshiunda said the driver died at the scene while the remaining five suspects were arrested and taken to hospital. “The suspects were found in possession of three firearms and 19 rounds of ammunition. “Two of the firearms were  linked  to house robbery cases in Malvern and Pinetown  in December 2022.” The five suspects who survived the crash, aged between 20 and 27,  will appear in court soon.
