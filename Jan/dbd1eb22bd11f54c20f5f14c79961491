Basic education minister Angie Motshekga and  KwaZulu-Natal education MEC Mbali Frazer  witnessed  tearful and anxious little ones at Kwazikumnandi preschool on Wednesday. Motshekga patted Hlelokuhle Ndaba, five, on his back and asked him why he was crying when she visited the Umlazi facility to assess the state of readiness as coastal schools start the academic year. Principal Zodwa Mdinga said they were elated by the visit to the school, which has  more than 100 children. She said  one of the main challenges  was  leaking  sewage on the road leading to the school, which  poses a danger  for the toddlers. The ministerial  delegation also visited nearby Nkonkoni Primary School  and  will visit  schools in Parlock and La Mercy. This is a developing story.
