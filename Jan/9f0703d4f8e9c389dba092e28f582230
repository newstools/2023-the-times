The 80th annual Golden Globes kicked off awards season this month, and many of our favourite stars took to the red carpet for their big wins. While the  gold statuettes are on everyone’s mind, here is a look at all the winners’ best outfits. Julia Garner gave us a pretty look in this Gucci gown. We absolutely  love the whimsical three-layered tiered gown accentuated by her bejewelled bodice and the bleach blond pixie is the cherry on top. On-trend stars included Justin Hurwitz in this brown suit with a  matching bowtie that proves earthy tones and rusty golds are style notes  everyone should be following. Bringing the metallic magic is Angela Bassett in this Pamela Roland gown. Tyler James Williams is quickly becoming one to watch on red carpets. Moving away from the traditional black tuxedos we are used to seeing, he gives us this fun look from Amiri’s recent collection. While she may be a favourite for her campy performances, we could have done with similar pizazz from Jennifer Coolidge. Sometimes the best red carpet moments are not only because of the clothing but the moments people create as well. Hauser gives us a laugh after receiving his award. While they might not be winners, there are plenty of stars who had  memorable looks on the red carpet. Anya Taylor Joy stunned in this sunny yellow ensemble from Dior while Donald Glover gave us leisurely glam in his YSL pyjama set. Triangle of Sadness star Dony De Leon was not looking to take on dowdy or shy pieces  in this racy AZ Factory custom.
