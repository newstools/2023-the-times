The City of Tshwane is  monitoring measles cases and its outbreak response teams  are ready to  curb the spread as far as possible. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has declared a measles outbreak in Limpopo, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, the Free State and the North West. In Tshwane, 14 laboratory-confirmed cases have been recorded since May 2022. The latest case in Tshwane,  reported on December 30, was of a four-year-old boy from Hammanskraal. “During late December  the city implemented a measles vaccination campaign as a  preventive measure, targeting children from the ages of six months to 15 years. “In addition to this, the city launched an awareness campaign to mobilise and keep communities informed through  radio stations and social media,”  MMC for health Rina Marx said on Wednesday. She advised parents and caregivers to  take their children to  the municipality’s clinics for vaccination. The NICD had indicated  the  outbreak was due to low vaccine coverage. “At this stage of reporting, there is no indication of a cluster outbreak of measles in Tshwane. However, this situation could change as cross-provincial travel is expected to increase  before the reopening of schools.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
