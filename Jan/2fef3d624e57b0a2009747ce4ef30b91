Amid the massive water disruptions, Johannesburg Water on Tuesday said it was monitoring regions that may have low pressure and had deployed   tankers to areas where there is little or no supply. The entity said it could take more than 72 hours for its system to fully recover after  the power outage at the Eikenhof pump station at the weekend.
