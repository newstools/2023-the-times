Emergency services arrived on the scene to find total carnage, said ALS Paramedics. "Four trucks and four light motor vehicles collided on the highway and ambulances and advanced life-support paramedics were dispatched. One truck driver was seriously injured and entrapped in his vehicle. "Paramedics worked to stabilise the man, while the eThekwini fire department used the jaws of life and other hydraulic equipment to free him from the wreckage. Thereafter he was transported to hospital. "Multiple others sustained injuries ranging from moderate to serious. They were stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital," the emergency service said. Events leading to the accident are unknown, but the SAPS is investigating, it added.
