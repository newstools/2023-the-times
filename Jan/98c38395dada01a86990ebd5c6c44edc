President Cyril Ramaphosa’s application to find out whether  his private prosecution by former president Jacob Zuma is lawful will be heard on May 17 and 18. The date was set  in a case management meeting  in the Johannesburg high court on Wednesday. On Monday, the full bench of the high court granted Ramaphosa an interim interdict, prohibiting any further steps by Zuma in his private prosecution of Ramaphosa. This means  Ramaphosa will not have to appear in the criminal court on Thursday as per the summons issued by Zuma on December 15. The interdict will remain in place pending the determination of Ramaphosa’s main application  on May 18. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
