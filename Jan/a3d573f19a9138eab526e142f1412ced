A 40-year-old suspect was arrested  in connection with the kidnapping and murder of  26-year-old  Venolia Thobile  Skhosana, who was a member of the EFF in Limpopo. The suspect was arrested after the Unisa student’s body was found in an advanced state of decomposition in a river at Khathazweni, outside the Hlogotlou police area, on Thursday. Limpopo police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said the victim reportedly went missing at 2pm on New Year’s Eve. “A missing person file was opened at Hlogotlou police station and officers immediately commenced with  initial investigations which revealed  the victim was last seen at Holnek village in the Zaaiplaas policing area when she was attending an event,” he said. Mojapelo said the police team led by  Hlogotlou station commander  Lt-Col Ntoane Masuku operationalised information received which led to the arrest of the suspect and discovery of Skhosana’s body. The suspect is expected to appear in the Nebo magistrate’s court on Friday  to face charges of kidnapping and murder. More charges could be added. The EFF in Limpopo noted the untimely passing of Skhosana, who was allegedly abducted by a local man. “It is alleged  the perpetrator lured the victim to the  bush at Sehlakwane village, in Elias Motsoaledi, on  December 31 2022 where he raped her and strangled her to death. “Fighter Thobile’s lifeless body was  found dumped in the early hours  today [Thursday] at Sehlakwane village, not far from the local sports ground where she was allegedly abducted by the 40-year-old man while attending a New Year’s Eve event,” the party said.
