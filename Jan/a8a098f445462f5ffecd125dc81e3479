An eight-year-old girl was  swept off the Peace Valley bridge in Pietermaritzburg after  the heavy rains which struck KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday. It is understood the girl was with her mother when they were trying to cross a low-lying bridge across the Msunduzi River. Local ward councillor Dumisani Phungula told TimesLIVE the mother had a younger child on her back and was also holding the eight-year-old girl. Phungula said according to the mother, the girl lost her grip and was swept away. He said the mother  crossed and called for help. “It's a very tragic thing to happen. We visited the family as soon as we heard about the incident and  called for assistance from the rescuers. “The problem  is the water is flowing and the teams are unable to  look for the child.  They have told us they will have to wait  for  water levels to lower.” Phungula said divers are, however, conducting  searches. He said this was not the first incident  at the same spot. Phungula warned  residents to avoid crossing  low-lying bridges as they are dangerous. The KwaZulu-Natal department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs  placed disaster teams on high alert after the South African Weather Service issued a severe weather warning for large parts of the province on Thursday and Friday. Department spokesperson Senzelwe Mzila said the warning indicated  large parts of KwaZulu-Natal could expect disruptive rainfall, with  the probability of widespread flooding. The department urged  residents to avoid rivers and low-lying bridges. TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
