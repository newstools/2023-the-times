Musician Zakes Bantwini has been rubbing shoulders with a lot of stars recently and when he was spotted with American rapper Post Malone at the Fifa World Cup fans wondered if the pair were cooking up something in studio. Zakes  shared photos of himself with the rapper taken by BlaQ Smith at a fashion show  in Qatar. In a statement shared with TshisaLIVE by IMG Africa Press, it was revealed the two were discussing possible future collabos. “The pair met  at the show and discussed  working together on a future music project as well as the potential of Zakes hosting Post for a show in South Africa in the near future. Post was previously in South Africa in 2019 for a performance at The Dome for Castle Lite Unlocks.” Zakes is  due to travel to the US for the Grammy Awards where he's nominated for Bayethe alongside multiple Grammy Awards winner Wouter Kellerman and Nomcebo Zikode. He's also set to wrap up his final studio album before  retiring this year. Zakes told TshisaLIVE he was ready to hang up his  mic and release his last album after 19 years as a musician. He said he was not retiring from music but  bowing out as a recording artist. “I don't want to say I'm retiring from music, but  this is my last album  I'm working on under this brand. It's over for Zakes Bantwini. “But Zakhele Madida is still going to produce music for other people, and you know, they  say you should quit while you are on top. I will tell you now, my music is classic, I'm enjoying a big success. I'm nominated at the Grammys, I hope I win so  I really bow out with a grand bow.” Zakes released his Ghetto King album in 2021 which bagged him his first  South African Music Award.
