The gloves are off as Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa says she's ready to do a tell-all interview amid renewed interest in her failed marriage. This after her estranged husband, Grammy-award-winning producer and DJ Black Coffee, took to his social media timeline on Saturday announcing he is prepared to finally do an interview on Podcast and Chill. “Ready to come and chill Gents Sol Phenduka and MacG,” he wrote. Fans of the DJ and podcast assumed Black Coffee intended to tell all in the much anticipated interview with controversial podcaster MacG. Actress Enhle suggested on her Instagram stories on Tuesday she had received unsettling emails (from an unidentified person) which made her want to do a sit-down interview with American news channel CNN. “This guy is too much, I want an interview both of us [in] one room CNN! The email I just read! Now planting stuff! It's getting increasingly dangerous,” she wrote. Enhle said regardless of the outcome, she wanted to make sure her career and children were protected. “This has been so unnecessary and a bore. I will continue with my normal day (if there is any longer such a thing for me). If you want everything to be spoken of, let's do it. Be brave enough to come at me straight. Embarrassment has happened already. A travesty if you ask me, “Lastly, the most important things for me are my children, their wellbeing, my career, and myself. Like I've been saying from the beginning of this disgusting low vibrational mess. Give me and my children space please as we complete this polygon of a dilemma Attempts by TshisaLIVE to get comment from Enhle and Black Coffee were unsuccessful at the time of publishing this article.
