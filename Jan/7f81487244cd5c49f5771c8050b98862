The Mozambican government has committed to working closely with the South African police service to curb ongoing border crime, particularly   vehicles  stolen in northern KwaZulu-Natal. This was the message national police commissioner Gen Fannie Masemola delivered to stakeholders during an engagement session at the Kwamduku community hall in Hluhluwe on Tuesday. Masemola was leading a delegation of senior officers joined by provincial commissioner Lt-Gen Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi to assess the  response by police to cross-border crimes. The visit follows the recent torching of at least six vehicles, including a tourist bus and a truck, on the R22  between Hluhluwe and Mbazwana. It is alleged communities living next to the Mozambique border are fed up with little to no action by authorities to curb the theft of motor vehicles which are transported to Mozambique. Masemola said residents were angry about the crimes, especially because once their vehicles had been stolen and crossed the border, they did not come back. He said they  invited a delegation from Mozambique to come and  discuss frustrations with the community. “They have committed to work with us. We are going to have more engagements from today and come back to give the community a response within a week or two,” he said. Masemola said  more than 100 police officers have been deployed to the area since Sunday, including special crime-fighting  units. “In the long term we are going to  establish a unit, which has  been approved in a district but is yet to be approved at  national level, which will deal with these crimes. “We are also going to  fill the vacant post under the organised crime unit and bring them closer to the area so  they can deal with  crime.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
