A 22-year-old Mpumalanga man has been sentenced to life imprisonment for killing his father over a lack of support for his music career. Mpumalanga High Court judge Greyling Coetzer sentenced Siphamandla Gift Khumalo for murdering his 47-year-old father Bheki Eric Khumalo. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Mpumalanga spokesperson Monica Nyuswa told TimesLIVE Siphamandla pleaded guilty last week to murdering his father. “In his plea, the accused told the court  his relationship with the deceased became sour after he did not support him in his career choice of becoming a musician. His father wanted him to pursue a career in engineering. “The accused felt  the deceased was a stumbling block  in his dream career,” Nyuswa said. Nyuswa said Siphamandla left their home in Mayflower to go to his father’s business in Ermelo, where he stabbed him in the neck. “Prosecutor advocate Eugene Mathebula handed in a victim impact statement compiled by the deceased’s wife. “The wife  said she is now a widow. She claimed the community and deceased's family suspected she colluded with the accused to kill the deceased. She added her husband was the sole breadwinner and now that he is gone, life has become a nightmare,” Nyuswa said. She said Coetzer found no substantial reasons to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence  of life imprisonment, adding that a social worker report presented in court stated Siphamandla was not a candidate with high chances of rehabilitation. “The  NPA welcomes the conviction and sentence. We encourage people to seek professional help when they encounter similar problems in their family conflicts.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
