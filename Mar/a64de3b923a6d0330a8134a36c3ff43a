A search is  under way along the R511 road between  Hartbeespoort Dam and Pretoria, where a lion is reported to be on the loose. According to Arthur Crewe, of security company Strategic Response Unit, their reaction officer spotted the lion in the early hours of Wednesday. “The reaction officer spotted the lion along the Hennops hiking trail  about 2am. He alerted the office and we dispersed a conservation and rescue team to look for the lion. “While busy with the search  about 7am, a resident  told the team on the ground  confirmed having seen the lion. So this was the second confirmation,” he said. Crewe told TimesLIVE the searchers are using technology such as drones  and said they will do their best to ensure that the lion is rescued safely. “We are actively looking for the animal and ask residents not to shoot or approach the animal should they spot it. Contact us immediately if there are any sightings.” Crewe said since starting  their search operation, they have received hoax calls, including that the lion was shot and that the lion had killed another animal. “Someone called during the day to say an animal [pictured] had been  killed by the lion. On arrival at the scene, we found that the animal had been  knocked over by a vehicle,” he told TimesLIVE.
