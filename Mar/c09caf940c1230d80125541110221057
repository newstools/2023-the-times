Lady Du has  addressed that awks moment when rapper K.O mentioned her in a diss track. Taking to Twitter in a lengthy thread, she described a recent sit-down interview in which she opened up about a couple of things, including the cold war with  K.O. This after the rapper took a jab at Lady Du for saying SETE was "not going to amount to anything". “I never said I was bigger than K.O, let’s get that correct first. I said the reason I didn’t drop a diss track was because I checked the numbers on my streams and since he said I did nothing with myself, I was happy to see that some of the songs I was on were higher in streams,” Lady Du started her thread. “No man should ever come for a woman’s bread and butter, no matter what the situation is. We all don’t have the same set-up. I’m not signed to no record label that helps push my music, so, yes, my music might be dated, but it did what it had to. I respect people and educate where I can. “What I achieved in one year is something any woman should be proud of. I’m not being boastful, that’s not my character, nor do I feel like I have made it. It took me 15 years to make it. I made it when I was giving up on music. I worked hard to get to where I am for some1 to diss,” wrote Lady Du. In the verse, K.O said Lady Du should leave the gossip. “Sneak dissing is some sh*t I don't want to see a Lady Du. Grow up and leave the gossip. You posted in your stories trying to claim SETE wasn't gold but then a day a two it reached platinum. How did that make you look?” Early in February, the rapper released a new single titled Forecast 23, in which he made it known the gloves are off in 2023 and he’ll be “addressing everything”. Before he dropped the track, he had let his followers know that 2023 is going to go down. “Been truly blessed summer 22/23 and SETE is going diamond soon! However, I got a few things to get off my chest futhi ngiqondise iyigwegwe,” he wrote.
