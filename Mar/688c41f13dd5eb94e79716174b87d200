Dear silent Cyril, The country faces a major crisis because of the failure  by government to provide adequate financial support for the maintenance of  infrastructure required by Eskom to maintain electricity supply to the country. Former Eskom CEO André de Ruyter has  been accused of causing this failure. More than 20 years ago our head of state, head of government and head of the ruling party, Thabo Mbeki, downplayed the need to invest in new power generation. Can you, as  head of state and Jacob Zuma’s deputy for more than five years, for which we paid you an adequate salary,  provide us with a list of the annual expenditure on the infrastructure of power generation? Can you also tell us whether Mbeki’s reluctance to back new power generation was  rescinded by Zuma when you were in office with him? It seems curious that you all blame De Ruyter for what appears to be a failure by the government. I believe De Ruyter did his best to maintain Eskom despite the failure of government to provide support. SJJ van den Berg • You too can join the discussion.
