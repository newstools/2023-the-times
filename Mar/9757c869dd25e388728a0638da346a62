"To effectively oversee the electricity crisis response, the appointed Minister will have politicalresponsibility, authority and control over all critical aspects of the Energy Action Plan. "This will help to deal with the challenge of fragmentation of responsibility across variousdepartments and Ministers which, while appropriate under normal circumstances, is notconducive to a crisis response. The Minister will be expected to facilitate the coordination of the numerous departments andentities involved in the crisis response, work with the Eskom leadership to turn around theperformance of existing power stations, and accelerate the procurement of new generationcapacity." Ramaphosa revealed that he had transferred certain powers to Ramokgopa to enable him to do his job.
