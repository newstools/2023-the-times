Speculation that former Uzalo star Wiseman Mncube will  star in a biopic based on  kwaito star Mandoza's life has sparked debate  about whether he would give a good portrayal. Wiseman's involvement in the project was tipped by social media users who claimed the biopic is set to premiere on BET and be co-produced by his widow Mpho Tshabalala. But Mpho told TshisaLIVE the claims were  “wishful thinking”. “It is just the speculations of social media. People want to see it [a project like the biopic] is all.” The idea for a biopic got tongues wagging with fans sharing who they  think should be on the list. Blood Diamond star Mduduzi Mabaso was linked  to the role and some have also suggested The River and Shaka iLembe star Thembinkosi Mthembu would be a good fit. Wiseman has not publicly commented on the rumours. Mandoza died in September 2016 after battling cancer which “metastasised to his brain”. He  died on his way to hospital after his health  deteriorated. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
