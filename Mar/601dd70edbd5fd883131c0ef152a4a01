A KwaZulu-Natal family has blamed the  health workers' strike for the death of a Pietermaritzburg man. The family said they were informed Parthiben Perumal Naidoo, 58, died on Saturday morning. His daughter, Melanie Naidoo, said her father was admitted to  Greys Hospital, Pietermaritzburg, on February 27. A scan showed he had a 16cm cyst under his liver and gall stones. “He was doing well  [last] Monday when I saw him  and we talked and laughed. I  went to the hospital daily  after he was admitted  to feed and bathe him.  As he wasn't eating, he needed someone to look after him and we left him in the care of nurses at the hospital. I tried going back  [last] Tuesday, but there was a strike and we were not allowed inside,” said Naidoo. The  strike  over wages by healthcare workers started  last Monday. The workers are striking under the banner of the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu). Naidoo said they  tried calling the hospital for updates, but no-one  answered the phone. No-one contacted them about  her father’s condition. On Saturday morning she received a call from the hospital  informing  her he  had died. She said when they got to the hospital on Saturday, the circumstances that led to his  death were unclear. “Nurses told us  he was supposed to go to ICU on Thursday, but  as there was no-one [there], workers were on strike, that didn't happen. We were also told  he was scheduled for a procedure on Friday, but there were no nurses and doctors couldn't perform an operation.” She said the family was angry as they  were left without answers about what happened to her father. A hospital staff member said the strike was  continuing on Monday. She said  though  some staff  continued to work,  there were not enough to care for every patient.
