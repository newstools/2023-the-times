“Shape up or ship out.” This is the  warning ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula has sent  to party deployees, some of whom have become  complacent in their positions in government. Cabinet members, mayors and other deployees will no longer be comfortable in their jobs while the country and municipalities continue to deteriorate, Mbalula said. The ANC government has been criticised by many for its failures, including a lack of  basic service delivery, job creation  and deteriorating infrastructure, including roads, among other things. This has led to suggestions that these failures will come back to bite the ANC in the  2024 national and provincial  elections. Mbalula, who has been at the helm of Luthuli House for just under two months,  has promised to crack the whip, saying  non-performers have no place in  the ANC. “Those who don’t perform, their days are numbered. You don’t perform, you are out.” He attributed the party's failures to a “weak ANC at Luthuli House”. Now the  party is going to  look at  municipalities and departments it runs  and intervene where needed, he said. The  ANC's second deputy secretary-general Maropene Ramokgopa  will  focus on monitoring and evaluating the work of  deployees. Mbalula said ministers cannot keep appearing  in interviews on TV while they have nothing to show for it. “This thing of ministers being loose and not being held accountable will come to an end. Ministers have not been held accountable by the party because the ANC has been  weak in Luthuli House.” Deployees in government were  jeopardising the ANC’s electoral fortunes as many South Africans  are unhappy with the party's performance, he added. “Truth be told, some of our comrades are letting us down in a very big way, we must not camouflage that.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
