Khumbulani “Kay” Sibiya has refuted  rape and assault allegations against him. In a Facebook post, former Gagasi FM presenter Zukiswa “Zookey Zarling” Vuthela accused the actor of allegedly raping her. Responding to questions around the allegations, Zukiswa said she was opening up about her "truths". The actor denied the claims in an official statement, saying he had handed the matter to his legal representatives. “The truth is, I did not rape nor assault Miss Zukiswa “Zookey Zarling” Vuthela at any time,” he wrote. Kay added his family was affected by the allegations, and he had opened a case of defamation of character and false accusations against her. "If Ms Z. Vuthela has any other comments, I would like to ask that she and her legal team get in touch with my attorneys. “The South African justice system will handle this case and ultimately at the end the truth shall prevail.” Attempts for comment from Zukiswa were unsuccessful at the time of publishing. Updates will be included once received.
