Lamiez Holworthy has reflected on the orphanage home she has built for 30 children. Taking to Instagram she shared how she started the journey with no funding and went on to thank everyone who walked with her in her path to provide a home for the children. She said starting an orphanage was a dream come true and she was now looking after the children with zero funding and zero sponsors. "I’ve been blessed and lucky enough to finally find a space that we’ve slowly been transforming in to a dream home for my kiddies and can’t tell you just how happy this makes me," she wrote. "Many have called me crazy for taking on such a huge responsibility with the state of our country,state of our economy and all that is happening around me (throw in my own stress and responsibilities) but I find comfort in knowing that Modimo Le Badimo Baka would not plant such a big dream in me without giving me the resources to make it happen. "Is there still a lot of work to be done?! Yea sure but almost five years later and we’ve made it this far. The same Gods that made a way then will make a way now." The Metro FM DJ  first opened up on Twitter about her dream of opening an orphanage for children in need. “I dreamt of building an orphanage. I saw it in my dreams. God then showed me where and we acted. Some would call it crazy to take on such a task in such a dark time where many of us aren’t earning what we used to,” wrote Lamiez at the time. Lamiez added that in the wake of such challenges, she reminded herself that her good deeds are for a larger purpose. “Sometimes I feel like I bit off way more than I can chew regarding my orphanage and then I remember that this is bigger than me. Modimo le Badimo Baka always make a way,” said Lamiez.
