Jazz musician Jonathan Butler says meeting Trevor Noah  in the Mother City  recently brought a big smile on his face. Trevor has been spotted in several places across Mzansi, and when Jonathan met him he headed straight to his Instagram timeline to share his excitement with his followers. "A perfect way to end Sunday night in the Mother City last night. Cape Town meeting the gifted and talented amazing brother from home, Trevor Noah. I am a big fan and it brought a big smile to my face. What are the odds of meeting up in the same place in the same city, my city, Cape Town. It was great connecting with you, Trevor. Keep making the world a better and happier place. Love you, my brother." Trevor was in Mzansi when Kevin Heart performed his Reality Check Comedy Tour at the SunBet Arena in Time Square, Pretoria earlier this month. Kevin said he was stunned by the warm reception Trevor received. “Last night's show in Pretoria was one for the record books. My brother Trevor Noah surprised the audience with a pop up and got one of the biggest applauses I have ever witnessed. He then brought me up and the rest is history. I can’t thank you all enough. Mpho Hart loves SA. Until next time guys,” he wrote in an Instagram post. South African-born author Zakes Mda recently applauded Trevor after he successfully hosted the Grammy Awards for the third time. "I’ve lived in the US for 42 years. I never ever imagined  in my lifetime I would see a South African hosting the Grammys. Trevor Noah is doing us proud day by day. So are the South African musicians who won a Grammy."
