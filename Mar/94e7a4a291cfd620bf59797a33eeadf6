On Saturday night television A-listers put their best foot forward when they walked  across the red carpet. Stars like reality TV star and businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize, actress Nefisa Mkhabela, Mandla N, Skeem Saam actor Thabiso Molokomme and the couple that has Mzansi glued to their lives, Motlatsi Mafatshe and Gabby Tshabalala. As soon as the red carpet was done we were ushered into the venue and the sixth Royalty Soapie Awards got under way without a glitch and we were told to carry on as if the show was live. It was jokes all around as host Mpho Popps kept the audience entertained. Those of who will be watching the ceremony on TV have no idea how much of a goofball the comedian was behind the scenes. Busiswa opened the performances for the evening. In between the ads Mpho kept the audiences laughing. Sjava performed songs from his album Isibuko and Nomfundo Moh also graced the stage. Veteran actress Connie Chiume was presented with a lifetime achievement award. In her acceptance speech Connie recounted her early years in the industry and the people that gave her a chance to do what she said was her first love. Winnie Ntshaba lauded newly appointed minister of sports arts and culture Zizi Kodwa and revealed that it's the first time a minister honoured their invitation. She also said the seventh Royalty Awards will be an all inclusive and African edition where some categories will be available for creatives across the continent. The awards ceremony will be broadcast on March 25 at 8pm on SABC1.
