J'Something has  opened his restaurant, Artistry, in Sandton. Taking to  Instagram,  he shared snaps of the opening night and  said the restaurant  will start  with limited seating. “Opening weekend has been so blessed. We decided to take things nice and slow and get in just enough people to make sure we could give everyone all our love and care with every step of the way. As we go, and as we feel more confident, we will open up more seats but, for now, grab yourself a seat and swing by for some food, great cocktails and dope music,” he said, linking to the restaurant's website. Speaking to TshisaLIVE almost two weeks ago the musician and chef said opening the establishment had been a lifelong dream. “This is a place unlike anything else I've  been to or seen. This is out of a vision or desire to bring soothing entertainment together in a way that would  create focus and respect the art behind everything. “I've always wanted to create something that's worth bringing food and entertainment together on a personal level. I don't cook because I want to be a chef. I cook because I love food and cooking for others, because its an amazing act of service. “I'm  excited about what we are doing because it feels like  I've put my heart, soul and character into it, but it's not about me, it's about the artistry of things.” Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times.
