Pearl Modiadie says motherhood is no walk in the park but she is grateful for the moments shared with her toddler son. Taking to her Instagram timeline recently the media personality shared snaps and a video of her son Lewatle, who had just woken up and was full of energy. She left him a sweet note on social media. "I love having you around, kiddo. You’re the best part of my every day. Being a mom isn’t a walk in the park, but you’ve made it all worth it. Here’s to making you the happiest human on earth," she captioned her post. In her mentions other moms shared their experiences of motherhood and raising toddlers. "Yooo tell me about it, motherhood is not easy I don't know when last I've had a good eight-hour sleep. but here we are, still pushing," commented one mother. The mother of one has always been open about her journey into motherhood and  recently shared about her birthing experience. Pearl revealed in 2022 that one of the reasons she was reluctant to have baby number two was because she couldn't forget the awful memory of having an epidural needle inserted. "Almost two years in and I still can’t get over the trauma of the epidural needle insertion. The feeling afterwards makes up for it, but I can feel it all over again when I watch my birth video. Issa lot mate!”
