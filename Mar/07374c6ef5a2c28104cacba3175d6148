After the discovery, city manager Johann Mettler wrote to the IEC notifying it of a vacancy for a COPE proportional representative councillor. However,  after receiving Makwarela’s certificate, Mettler has withdrawn the vacancy declaration In a statement, the city confirmed the reinstatement of the executive mayor with all his benefits and perks returned.
