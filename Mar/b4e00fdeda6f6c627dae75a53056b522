Mamelodi Sundowns coach Rulani Mokwena says Mothobi Mvala’s  repeated head injuries are not a cause for concern. It has been noticeable that Mvala often finishes  the games he plays for Sundowns with  a bloodstained bandage  on his head. In sport, head injuries are treated with extra caution as they have ended the careers of many sports stars in various codes. But Mokwena said Masandawana’s medical team have not flagged any problems  about Mvala. The coach said it’s  the physical way the combative former Highlands Park star plays that leads to him  often having his head strapped up. “The head injuries are just unfortunate,” Mokwena said. “Like a teacher who goes home with a lot of chalk stains, like a mechanic who goes home with a lot of oil stains, unfortunately Mothobi has a situation where in a game he gets a bit of blood on the jersey. “I  think it’s a demonstration of not only commitment and 'steelness' of a human being [he is], but his character is just that. “As long [as the injuries] are not severe and the situations don’t demand further medical prognosis I don’t really have an opinion on it.” After playing mostly as a central or attacking midfielder at Highlands, 28-year-old Bafana Bafana international Mvala has been converted into a centreback this season by Mokwena. As a midfielder, he used to bang in goals for the Lions of the North in   the DStv Premiership and Motsepe Foundation Championship. Now he seemingly bangs heads as a defender. Mvala and runaway DStv Premiership leaders Sundowns will  hope to continue their excellent form in their Nedbank Cup last 16 clash against Marumo Gallants at Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein on Thursday evening (6pm). The two sides were the finalists in the competition last season where Downs emerged 2-1 winners in the tightly contested match in Rustenburg.
