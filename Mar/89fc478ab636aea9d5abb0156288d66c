Temba Bavuma’s 21st Test half-century dragged the Proteas' lead past 200 at tea on day two of the second Test against the West Indies in Johannesburg on Friday. The South African captain went into the break on 81, an innings in which he has shown immense powers of concentration to help his team regain control after losing four wickets in the first session. Bavuma struck nine fours helping the Proteas recover from 32/3 after the first hour of play, to a position of relative solidity on 145/5, the lead 214 runs. It was slow going for most of the afternoon, with the Proteas  looking to rebuild after a disastrous morning. The West Indies seam bowlers deserve credit for their discipline, while Kraigg Brathwaite was intent on creating frustration to draw errors out of the Proteas batters. Normally, more attacking fields would be expected with a team on 69/4, as was the case when the Proteas resumed after lunch. Instead, Brathwaite set strong offside fields, inviting the Proteas to drive, but with fielders cutting off sure-fire boundaries he hoped to frustrate them. It wasn’t the most imaginative captaincy but it worked, especially in the case of Heinrich Klaasen, who played an awful pull, the ball flying off the top edge giving Joshua Da Silva his third catch of the innings. He scored just 14 but was the only wicket to fall in the session. There will be questions about Klaasen’s place, particularly as the player he replaced in the squad, Kyle Verreynne, did little wrong and wasn’t deserving of being axed. He was often South Africa’s best player in Australia and his spot has to be reconsidered when South Africa’s Test programme resumes in December. Wiaan Mulder, another whose position is under scrutiny, showed the patience  Klaasen lacked and  occasionally pierced the offside after struggling initially. His partnership with Bavuma is  worth 41 runs, at tea he was on 15. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
