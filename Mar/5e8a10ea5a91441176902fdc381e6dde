Two  alleged  armed robbers were shot dead while another was  wounded in a shoot-out  with police in Olifantsfontein on Monday morning. Police crime intelligence received information that suspects were plotting to commit an armed robbery and car hijacking in Ekurhuleni. Police spokesperson Lt-Col Mavela Masondo said a multidisciplinary team of law enforcement officers was established to  watch the suspects. This included  Ekurhuleni central crime intelligence, the  South African Police Highway Patrol Unit, Gauteng Traffic Police, Tracker Connect and Bad Boyz Security. “The team spotted three suspects driving a GWM SUV and intercepted them. The suspects fired shots at the team and a shoot-out ensued,” Masondo said. While fleeing, the suspects’ vehicle collided with a fence. Two suspects were fatally shot and the third  was wounded. None of the law enforcement members were injured, Masondo said. “Police recovered three unlicensed firearms  used by the suspects during the shoot-out. Preliminary investigation revealed  the vehicle driven by the suspects was reportedly hijacked in Sandringham earlier this month and  was fitted with  false registration number [plates],” he said. The  wounded suspect will be charged with conspiracy to commit an armed robbery, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, possession of a hijacked vehicle and attempted murder, among other  things.
